* Fixed issue where :doc:`SixDOF Tuner<../wkf_plugin/wk_six_dof_tuner>` would not open with Warlock via the Tune Controls button, and when initialized manually, would not find the test platform. (:issue:`AFSIM-2110`)
* Errors caused by failing :doc:`Performance Tests<../mc_performance>` now alert the user that a test has failed. Previously, errors would only be generated if test results were not in the expected directory. (:issue:`AFSIM-2110`)
* High-detail movers are no longer given active :model:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR` definitions. Example definitions are still provided in the platform file, but commented out. This will be the case at least while grammar for :model:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR` is under active development, as mismatches between Mover Creator script output and expected grammar can cause vehicle testing to fail. (:issue:`AFSIM-2110`)
* Corrected a units error that caused aircraft range tests to output unreasonable data. (:issue:`AFSIM-2108`)
