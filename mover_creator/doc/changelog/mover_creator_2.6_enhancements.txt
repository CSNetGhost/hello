* Flying wing, v-tail, and inverted v-tail models are now provided as standard templates. *(Issue #134)*
* Added more airfoils for use within Mover Creator. *(Issue #134)*
* Improved speed brake aerodynamic modeling. *(Issue #135)*
* Made use of the dimensionless reduced frequency (see :command:`use_reduced_frequency`) to compute the stability derivatives, which has the effect of linearizing the :command:`aero_data`. *(Issue #142)*
* Added support for thrust vectoring. *(Issue #145)*
* Enabled event pipe data in the flight test scenario generated by Mover Creator. *(Issue #146)*
* Added options for SAS and bank-to-turn / skid-to-turn controls. *(Issue #150)*
* Added support for wing control surfaces, including ailerons, dragerons/decelerons, spoilers, spoilerons, and elevons. *(Issue #157)*
* All control surfaces may now be either full-flying or hinged. *(Issue #157)*
* Added support for vehicle configuration with two ventral tails and vehicle configuration with an inverted v-tail. *(Issue #159)*
* Mover Creator now automatically shifts the vehicle's center of gravity to its reference point before performing aerodynamic calculations. *(Issue #162)*
* Linux is now supported. *(Issue #168)*
