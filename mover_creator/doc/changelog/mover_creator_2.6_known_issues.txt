* There is a lack of accuracy in some aerodynamic predictions, especially transonic drag. This is being improved.
* There are seemingly random font sizing problems. This is due to a conflict between Qt and Windows (acknowledged by both Qt and Microsoft) which may cause incorrect font size. If this happens, logout and login again.
* There are issues with running Mover Creator on 4k displays. If this occurs, it is recommended to maximize the Mover Creator window.
* There is currently no temperature limit on jet engine (turbojet/turbofan) performance. As a result, engines may produce excessively high thrust at low altitudes.
* Grid fins are not yet supported.
