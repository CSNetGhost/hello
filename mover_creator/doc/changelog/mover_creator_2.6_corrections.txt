* **(2.6.2)** Fixed issue where running Mover Creator on Linux would sometimes crash the application when performing a variety of actions. *(Issue #199)*
* **(2.6.2)** Fixed issue where performance tests would not run on Linux. *(Issue #201)*
* **(2.6.2)** Fixed erroneous calculation of surface area for :ref:`Bodies`. *(Issue #203)*
* Fixed issue where negative drag would be computed under certain circumstances. *(Issue #144)*
* The sweep angle specified in the :doc:`Geometry<../mc_geometry>` page for surfaces is now drawn correctly using leading edge sweep. *(Issue #158)*
* Fixed issue where top-half-round and bottom-half-round nacelles would have their center of gravity placed along the wrong plane. *(Issue #164)*
* Changed the aerodynamic center for bodies to be coincident with their center of gravity. *(Issue #164)*
* Fixed a crash that occurred by attempting to execute a performance test without first selecting a test. *(Issue #165)*
* Various aerodynamic prediction corrections/improvements. *(Issue #166)*
* Resolved issue where PID preferences were not being loaded correctly. *(Issue #167)*
* Fixed issue were aerodynamic vectors in wire-frame mode were drawn incorrectly when the vehicle's center of gravity was shifted to coincide with its reference point. *(Issue #170)*
* Resolved issue where the user-specified rotational inertias were not being used correctly in some cases. *(Issue #173)*
