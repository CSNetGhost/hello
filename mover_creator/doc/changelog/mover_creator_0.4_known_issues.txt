* There is currently no support for ailerons or flaps on wings in the beta version. This will be added in the initial release.
* Damping for yaw, pitch, and roll is still being refined.
* Tailless flying wing configurations are currently unsupported due to a lack of a yaw damper and split ailerons for yaw control.
* There is a lack of accuracy in some aerodynamic predictions, especially transonic drag. This is being improved.
* The current dihedral effect (Cl-beta) is often too weak, due to excessive roll damping (and required corresponding excessive roll control) in some configurations.
* There is currently no support for hinged aero surfaces (such as rudders, elevators, and ailerons) -- only full-flying (all moving) surfaces (such as stabilators) are currently supported.
* There is a known lack of accuracy in the relationship between roll control and damping and other stability derivatives.
* Aerodynamic damping, especially roll damping, needs additional stability derivatives.
* There is currently no Linux support for the beta release (although it will be supported later). Only Windows 64-bit is supported at this time.
* Wide variations in missile cg as propellant is burned can challenge autopilot control, which is currently tuned for a single cg location.
* There are seemingly random font sizing problems. This is due to a conflict between Qt and Windows (acknowledged by both Qt and Microsoft) which may cause incorrect font size. If this happens, logout and login again.
* Speed brakes have partial functionality (drag is modeled, but lift and side forces need improvement).
* The following control configurations are not yet supported: StabsTwoVentralTails, StabsVTail, and StabsInvertedVTail.
* Changing from a single tail to twin tail (or vice versa) for aircraft may result in loss of yaw control. This will be corrected in the next release.
* There may be some rendering problems with flight envelopes and turn performance plots. This is due to the rendering algorithm, not the P6DOF models themselves.
* The ability to adjust autopilot limits via the Mover Creator GUIs is currently quite limited. This will be expanded in the next release.
* There is currently no temperature limit on jet engine (turbojet/turbofan) performance. As a result, engines may produce excessively high thrust at low altitudes.
* The list of airfoil files is not complete and many airfoil files need some clean-up on their data.
* Grid fins are not yet supported.
* Cl vs Alpha-Beta-Mach may exhibit sign errors for some vehicle configurations. This is being investigated. For now, if a vehicle has this problem, set the global multiplier for Cl vs Alpha-Beta-Mach to zero.
