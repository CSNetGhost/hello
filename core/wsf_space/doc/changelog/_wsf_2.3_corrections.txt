* **(Issue #652)** Firing weapons from space platforms now behaves as expected.
* **(Issue #675)** :command:`csv_event_output` now supports orbital maneuver and orbit determination events (ORBITAL_MANEUVER_INITIATED, ORBITAL_MANEUVER_UPDATED, ORBITAL_MANEUVER_COMPLETED, ORBITAL_MANEUVER_CANCELED, ORBIT_DETERMINATION_INITIATED, ORBIT_DETERMINATION_UPDATED).
* **(ELSZ #30)** Two changes were made to the propagation algorithm of the :command:`default fluence_model<fluence_model.default>`: the calculation of beam spread from diffraction now uses a value of 0.25 * the aperture diameter for the 1/e beam profile, and the turbulent beam spread calculation was changed to account for variable atmospheric turbulence strength along the path of propagation.
