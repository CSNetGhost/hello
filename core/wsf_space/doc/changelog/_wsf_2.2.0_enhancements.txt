* **(Issue #239)** Implemented a :ref:`rocket-based orbital maneuvering model<orbital_maneuvering_models.rocket>` that expends delta-V according to the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.  Mass properties and thrust must be provided as rocket :ref:`stage<orbital_maneuvering_models.stage_commands>` inputs.
* **(Issue #251)** Added the :command:`access_report`\s output feature, providing reports of start time, end time, and the duration of platforms' visibility to each other.
* **(Issue #346)** Implement eclipse computations for :model:`WSF_SPACE_MOVER`, including :method:`eclipse methods<WsfSpaceMover.EclipseAnomalies>` and :command:`eclipse constraints<eclipse_entry>` for execution of orbital mission events.
* **(Issue #377)** Added the :command:`eclipse_report`\s output feature, providing reports of start time, end time, and the duration of platforms' being eclipsed by the Earth.
* **(Issue #392)** Implement attitude controller models used by :model:`WSF_SPACE_MOVER` and :model:`WSF_NORAD_SPACE_MOVER`.
