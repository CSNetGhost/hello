* Added a command to the :command:`WSF_SPACE_MOVER<WSF_SPACE_MOVER.designator>` and :command:`WSF_NORAD_SPACE_MOVER<WSF_NORAD_SPACE_MOVER.designator>` to specify the satellite designator, and updated the :method:`WsfSpaceMover.Designator` method to provide script access to it. *(Issue #1321)* *(Issue #1472)*
* Added satellite breakup modeling using :class:`WsfNASA_BreakupModel`. *(Issue #1340)*
* Added new space :command:`orientation<attitude_controller.orientation>` types (entity_with_solar_constraint, entity_with_nadir_constraint, entity_with_orbit_plane_constraint, point_with_orbit_plane_constraint), as well as the :command:`swap_axes<attitude_controller.swap_axes>` command to swap the pointing and constraint axes for the currently specified orientation.  The :method:`WsfSpaceMover.SetOrientation` method was also changed to accept a parameter of the new :class:`WsfSpaceOrientation` type, created to easily configure these new types (the original version of this method, accepting a string parameter, has been deprecated).  *(Issue #1413)*
* Added a number of convenience methods, initial orbital elements methods, and TLE related methods to :class:`WsfSpaceMover`. *(Issue #1444)* *(Issue #1475)* *(Issue #1477)*
* Added a :doc:`change_attitude<../change_attitude>` orbital event with a corresponding :class:`WsfChangeAttitude` script class. *(Issue #1493)*
