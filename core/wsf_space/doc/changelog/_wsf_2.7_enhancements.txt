* **(2.7.2)** Added versions of :method:`WsfSpaceMover.ComputeRendezvous` and :method:`WsfSpaceMover.ComputeIntercept` that calculate a rendezvous and intercept with a given fixed transfer time. *(AFSIM-973)*
* **(2.7.1)** Added :method:`RIC<WsfSpaceMover.RIC>` and :method:`RIC_AtTime<WsfSpaceMover.RIC_AtTime>` functions to :class:`WsfSpaceMover`. *(AFSIM-536)*
* Added a :ref:`orbital_dynamics_terms.jupiter_monopole` orbital dynamics term, and the associated script class, :class:`WsfJupiterMonopoleTerm`. *(Issue #2109)*
* Added :class:`WsfLibrationPoint` for querying the kinematics of libration points. *(Issue #2159)*
* Added a :command:`target` input block and an associated script class :class:`WsfTargetPoint` for specifying the target and offsets of some orbital maneuvers (the previous platform and offset commands are now deprecated). *(Issue #2159)*
* Added the feature to select the same orbital propagator for tracking with :ref:`orbit determination fusion <fusion_methods.orbit_determination>` or the :model:`WSF_ORBIT_DETERMINATION_FILTER` as the tracked target (by default); or one can configure a custom :command:`orbit_determination_fusion.propagator`.  These options provide for more accurate tracking over long periods of time. *(Issue #2200)*
