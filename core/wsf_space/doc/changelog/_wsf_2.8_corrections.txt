* **(2.8.1)** Corrected a problem where :doc:`orbit_determination<../orbit_determination_fusion>` fusion method was not producing a valid Initial Orbit Determination (IOD) result in the angles-only case (where only sensors that report bearing and elevation contribute to the IOD), particularly for satellites in Geosynchronous orbits. (:issue:`AFSIM-291`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue with :method:`WsfSolarTerminator.PlatformSolarIllumination` for platforms on the surface of the Earth, or which had no mover. (:issue:`AFSIM-1111`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue where the :command:`WSF_SPACE_OPTICAL_SIGNATURE.high_resolution_eclipse` option for the :model:`WSF_SPACE_OPTICAL_SIGNATURE` would incorrectly compute a zero solar illumination.
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected a problem where the three argument, :class:`WsfTrackId` accepting version of :method:`WsfInterceptManeuver.Construct` would silently fail and halt the simulation when used outside a platform's script context. (:issue:`AFSIM-555`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected issues where orbital targeting optimization (such as for the :doc:`../rendezvous` or :doc:`../intercept` maneuvers) would not find solutions, or give sub-optimal solutions. (:issue:`AFSIM-1347`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue where :method:`WsfSpaceMover.RIC_AtTime` would report incorrect results for platforms with no mover. (:issue:`AFSIM-1360`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue where :model:`WSF_INTEGRATING_SPACE_MOVER` would use an incorrect mass. (:issue:`AFSIM-1719`)
* Corrected an issue with :doc:`change_raan<../change_raan>` and :doc:`change_raan_inclination<../change_raan_inclination>` attempting to execute for equatorial orbits, resulting in an infinite loop. (:issue:`AFSIM-861`)
* :method:`WsfPlatform.FutureLocation` is now valid for platforms with a :model:`WSF_INTEGRATING_SPACE_MOVER`. (:issue:`AFSIM-640`)
* Corrected a problem where the :model:`WSF_ORBIT_DETERMINATION_FILTER` was not working properly due to incorrect initialization.
* Corrected a problem where an :command:`inherent_contrast` warning would be displayed on :model:`WSF_SPACE_OPTICAL_SIGNATURE`, which does not require it.
* Corrected a problem with the :command:`relative_time` orbital event constraint failing for unbounded orbits. (:issue:`AFSIM-557`)
* Corrected a problem with the documented description of the rotating frame used by the :class:`WsfLibrationPoint` script class. (:issue:`AFSIM-854`)
* :class:`WsfSpaceMover` methods :method:`PeriapsisAltitude<WsfSpaceMover.PeriapsisAltitude>` and :method:`ApoapsisAltitude<WsfSpaceMover.ApoapsisAltitude>` are now referenced to the mean radius of the appropriate :ref:`central_body<central_body_commands>`, rather than to the spherical earth radius. (:issue:`AFSIM-805`)
* Corrected problems with special cases of :doc:`change_inclination<../change_inclination>` maneuvers. This issue caused the :model:`WSF_NORAD_SPACE_MOVER` to enter an infinite loop when attempting to change to an equatorial, non-circular orbit. (:issue:`AFSIM-315`)
