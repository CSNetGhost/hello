Common Orbital Propagator Commands
**********************************

.. command:: central_body ... end_central_body
   :block:

   .. parsed-literal::

    central_body <central-body-type>
       polar_offset_angles_ ...
       ...
    end_central_body

   Specify the central body and related ellipsoid model that defines the origin of the coordinate system used for orbital propagation. Depending on the propagator type, propagation is affected by the central body's associated gravitational parameter.

   Options for *<central body type>* are the following:

   * earth_wgs72 (Earth World Geodetic System 1972): The central body ellipsoid is defined according to the WGS-72 standard.
   * earth_wgs84 (Earth World Geodetic System 1984): The central body ellipsoid is defined according to the WGS-84 standard.
   * earth_egm96 (Earth Gravity Model 1996): The central body ellipsoid is defined according to the EGM-96 standard.
   * moon:  The central body ellipsoid is defined according to published lunar parameters.
   * sun:   The central body ellipsoid is defined according to published solar parameters.
   * jupiter: The central body ellipsoid is defined according to published Jovian parameters.

   **Default** The central body selection specified in the :command:`global_environment<global_environment.central_body>` (the default for which is earth_wgs84).

   .. note:: If the specified central_body_ type is for a different central body from that defined in the :command:`global_environment<global_environment.central_body>` the reported location of the parent platform will be with respect to the global environment's central body.

   .. note::
      This command is currently only utilized for orbital propagation with the :model:`WSF_KEPLERIAN_PROPAGATOR` and the :model:`WSF_J2_PERTURBATION_PROPAGATOR`, limited to Earth central bodies.

.. command:: polar_offset_angles <angle-value> <angle-value>

   Specify the central_body_'s polar offset angles (:math:`x_p` and :math:`y_p`, respectively) of the Celestial Intermediate Pole (CIP) with respect to the WCS (ITRS) coordinate system.  Providing these values (of the order of tenths of arc-seconds) enables very precise conversions between ECI and WCS coordinates.

   **Default** The polar offset angles specified in the :command:`global_environment<global_environment.polar_offset_angles>` (0.0 rad 0.0 rad)
