Conjunction Setup Commands
==========================

.. parsed-literal::

   conjunction_setup
      <initial-position-specification>
      with_target <target-platform>
      at_time <time>
   end_conjunction_setup

.. command:: conjunction_setup ... end_conjunction_setup
   :block:
   
   Set this spacecraft's initial conditions such that a conjunction with a 
   given target spacecraft will occur at a specified time. During 
   initialization an attempt will be made to find a solution with 
   the given boundary conditions. If successful, this platform's state will
   be set so that the specified conjunction occurs. If there is no solution
   (for example, the orbit would take the satellite through the Earth),
   the velocity of the spacecraft will be set to a default value (see below).

   The initial position specification is one of the following: from_lla_, 
   from_eci_ or from_initial_.

.. command:: from_lla <latitude-value> <longitude-value> <length-value>

   Set the initial position of this spacecraft to the given latitude, 
   longitude and altitude. If there is no solution to the conjunction, the
   velocity of the spacecraft will be set to that of a circular orbit with
   a heading of 90 degrees.

.. command:: from_eci <length-value> <length-value> <length-value>

   Set the initial position of this spacecraft to the given position in the
   ECI frame. If there is no solution to the conjunction, the velocity of the
   spacecraft will be set to that of a circular orbit with a heading of 90
   degrees.

.. command:: from_initial

   Set the initial position of this spacecraft using other means to specify
   the initial orbit of the spacecraft. If there is no solution to the
   conjunction, the velocity of the spacecraft will be set to that provided
   by the other initialization methods.

.. command:: with_target <string-value>

   Specify the name of the target platform of the conjunction. This spacecraft 
   will move to the position of the target platform at the time specified in 
   the at_time_ command. The specified target must be the name of a platform 
   that moves in the space spatial domain.

.. command:: at_time <time-value>

   Specify the time at which this spacecraft should suffer a conjunction with
   the specified target.

.. command:: tolerance <real-value>

   Specify the tolerance for the conjunction solution. The default value of the
   tolerance is 1.0e-9.
