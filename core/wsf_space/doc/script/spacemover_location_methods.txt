Location Methods
================

.. method:: WsfGeoPoint LocationAtTime(double aSimTime)

   Return the location of the platform for the given simulation time, represented as a :class:`WsfGeoPoint`.

   .. note::
      The given time can be any time in the future or past.  This method returns the location the platform will be or has been, assuming it does not maneuver.

.. method:: Vec3 LocationECI_AtTime(double aSimTime)

   Return the location of the platform in the ECI frame for the given simulation time, represented as a :class:`Vec3`.

   .. note::
      The given time can be any time in the future or past.  This method returns the location the platform will be or has been, assuming it does not maneuver.

.. method:: Vec3 VelocityECI_AtTime(double aSimTime)

   Return the velocity of the platform in the ECI frame for the given simulation time, represented as a :class:`Vec3`.

   .. note::
      The given time can be any time in the future or past.  This method returns the velocity the platform will have or had, assuming it does not maneuver.
