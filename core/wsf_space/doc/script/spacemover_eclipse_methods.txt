Eclipse Methods
===============

.. method:: Array<double> EclipseAnomalies()

   Return the approximate true anomalies for the satellite's eclipse entry and exit.  If the satellite is in eclipse during its current orbit, the true anomaly of entry will be returned in the first element of the array, and the true anomaly of exit will be in the second element.  If there is no eclipse, the returned array will be empty.

.. method:: Array<double> EclipseTimes()

   Return the approximate simulation times for the satellite's eclipse entry and exit.  If the satellite is in eclipse during its current orbit, the time of entry will be returned in the first element of the array, and the time of exit will be in the second element.  If there is no eclipse, the returned array will be empty.

.. method:: int EclipsedState()

   Return whether the satellite is currently eclipsed.  The possible return values are the following:

   * 0 (not eclipsed)
   * 1 (in penumbral eclipse)
   * 2 (in full umbral eclipse)
