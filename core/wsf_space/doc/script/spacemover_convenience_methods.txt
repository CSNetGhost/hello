Convenience Methods
===================

.. method:: double OrbitalPeriod()

   Return the period of the platform's orbit in seconds.

.. method:: string OrbitalRegime()

   Return the orbital regime of the platform's orbit. Possible return values include:

   * 'LEO' when the apoapsis altitude is less than 2000 km;
   * 'MEO' when the apoapsis altitude is less than 35686 km and the periapsis
     altitude is greater than 2000 km;
   * 'GEO' when the altitude is within 100 km of 35786 km at all points
     along the orbit, the eccentricity of the orbit is less than 0.001, and the
     inclination is less than 90 degrees;
   * 'HEO' when the eccentricity is greater than 0.4;
   * an empty string when the orbit does not fall into one of the
     other regimes.

.. method:: double RevolutionNumber(double aTime)
            double RevolutionNumber(Calendar aTime)

   Return the number of revolutions that the platform has traversed since the
   given time.
   
   .. note::
      This uses the current orbital elements to calculate
      the number of revolutions, so this method will not give accurate
      results if the platform has maneuvered between the given time and now.
   
.. method:: Vec3 RIC(WsfPlatform aPlatform)
            Vec3 RIC(WsfTrack aTrack)

   Return radial, in-track, and cross-track distances between the 
   mover and the platform or track at the current time.

.. method:: Vec3 RIC_AtTime(double aTime, WsfPlatform aPlatform)
            Vec3 RIC_AtTime(double aTime, WsfTrack    aTrack)

   Return radial, in-track, and cross-track distances between the 
   mover and the platform or track at the specified time.
   
   .. note::
      The platform version of RIC_AtTime is only valid for platforms with no mover or a
      :model:`WSF_SPACE_MOVER`, :model:`WSF_AIR_MOVER`, 
      :model:`WSF_GROUND_MOVER` or :model:`WSF_SURFACE_MOVER`.
