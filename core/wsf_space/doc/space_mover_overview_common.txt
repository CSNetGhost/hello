The |SPACE_MOVER_MODEL| is capable of executing a variety of maneuvers.  Maneuvers can be specified through |SPACE_MOVER_MISSION_REF| inputs, or they may be scripted with the |SPACE_MOVER_SCRIPT_CLASS| script object and the mover's `script interface`_.  Configurable |SPACE_MOVER_MANEUVERING_REF| determine how delta-V is expended in mission sequences in which maneuvers are performed.

The mover's orientation is specified and controlled with the configurable |SPACE_MOVER_ATTITUDE_REF|.  A variety of standard :command:`orientation options<attitude_controller.orientation>` are provided, and the orientation can also be changed dynamically through script.

.. note::

   The :command:`start_date` and :command:`start_time`, or :command:`start_epoch` commands should also be defined in the scenario as they are required to properly compute the ephemeris data.
