Attitude Controller Models
==========================

.. parsed-literal::

   attitude_controller_ :ref:`<attitude-controller-model-name><attitude_controller_models>`
     ...
   end_attitude_controller

.. command:: attitude_controller ... end_attitude_controller
   :block:

   Specify the attitude controller for the platform. All platforms having a :model:`WSF_SPACE_MOVER` or 
   :model:`WSF_NORAD_SPACE_MOVER` will have an attitude controller of some kind. If no attitude controller block is specified, 
   the mover will operate as if the `instant <Instant Attitude Controller>`_ attitude controller was selected.

   Attitude controllers will attempt to change the orientation of the platform to match a given target orientation. At creation
   time, the attitude controller will have a target orientation specified by an 
   :command:`orientation command <attitude_controller.orientation>` in the attitude controller block. After creation, the 
   orientation target of the attitude controller can be changed via :class:`WsfSpaceMover.SetOrientation`.

   Target orientations are either a one-time selection of the target orientation, or it will connect the attitude controller to one 
   of the pre-set :command:`orientation types<attitude_controller.orientation>`. In the latter case, the attitude controller 
   will have a continually updated target orientation as the craft moves along its orbit.
