//! Retrieve the position and velocity of the @p aTarget relative to
//! @p aOrigin at the given @p aEpoch. The position and velocity will
//! be given in the ECI frame. The input @p aEpoch is a two-component
//! Julian date, where the epoch at which the ephemeris will be given
//! is the sum of the two components. For simplicity, the full Julian
//! date can be placed in the first component. However, for highest
//! precision interpolation, @p aTimeJD should have its first component
//! equal to the most recent midnight at or before the interpolation
//! epoch, and the second component equal to the fraction of a day since
//! that midnight.
//!
//! The input time is on the TDB scale which is different from TT by
//! periodic variations of magnitude less that 1.6 ms.
//!
//! @param aEpoch             - The epoch at which to produce the ephemeris.
//! @param aTarget            - The target body.
//! @param aOrigin            - The body to use as origin.
//! @param aPosition [out]    - The ephemeris position in km.
//! @param aVelocity [out]    - The ephemeris velocity in km/s.
