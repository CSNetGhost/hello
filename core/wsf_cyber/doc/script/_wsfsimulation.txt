Cyber Methods
=============

.. method:: bool CyberAttack(WsfPlatform aTarget, string aAttackType)
            bool CyberAttack(WsfPlatform aTarget, string aAttackType, WsfCyberAttackParameters aParameters)

   A special use case to launch a cyber attack. Typically, cyber attacks are initiated from the
   platform scope against a target platform. However, not all cyber attacks fit this definition,
   such as in the case of embedded cyber. The AFSIM cyber framework considers such attacks as
   self-inflicted, as in the attacking platform is the same as the victim. This method allows
   self-targeting cyber attacks for use cases such as embedded cyber, from the global scope.
   The target platform 'aTarget' is also the attacker in this method, and uses the attack type 'aAttackType'.
   'aAttackType' must be a valid :command:`cyber_attack` type.

   The version of this method using :class:`WsfCyberAttackParameters` allows for the passage of
   user defined parameters, in cases where effects associated with the attack can utilize or require
   such data.

   Returns true if the command was successful or false if one of the arguments was incorrect.

   .. note::

      Be mindful that the attacker is also the victim in this call, especially in terms of defining
      :command:`cyber_protect` for this platform. Any default cyber protection will also apply to
      any attack called in this way.

.. method:: int CyberEngagementScanDelayStatus(string aAttackType, WsfPlatform aAttacker, WsfPlatform aTarget)
            int CyberEngagementAttackDelayStatus(string aAttackType, WsfPlatform aAttacker, WsfPlatform aTarget)

   Queries for truth regarding the delay of the scan or attack engagement specified by the parameters provided. The integer
   return value indicates the current delay in the cyber engagement progression in the following manner:

   +--------------+------------------------+
   | Return Value |       Delay Type       |
   +==============+========================+
   |      0       |       Scan Delay       |
   +--------------+------------------------+
   |      1       |       Attack Delay     |
   +--------------+------------------------+
   |      2       | Attack Detection Delay |
   +--------------+------------------------+
   |      3       | Attack Recovery Delay  |
   +--------------+------------------------+
   |      4       |     Unused in Core     |
   +--------------+------------------------+
   |      5       |          None          |
   +--------------+------------------------+

   As indicated above, a return value of none is the result of an engagement that is
   not active or ongoing, has no delays, or could not be found matching
   the user supplied parameters.

.. method:: bool CyberScanCancel(string aAttackType, WsfPlatform aAttacker, WsfPlatform aTarget)
            bool CyberAttackCancel(string aAttackType, WsfPlatform aAttacker, WsfPlatform aTarget)

   Ends a scan or attack engagement, specified by the parameters provided, immediately during the current delay phase.
   The effect on the cyber engagement progression depends on the delay phase in which the engagement is canceled.

   * An attack or scan canceled during their initial delay will prevent the attack or scan and any subsequent actions.
   * An attack canceled during a detection delay will prevent subsequent detection and recovery by the target.
   * An attack canceled during attack recovery delay will not recover.

   This method returns true if the engagement was successfully found and canceled. It will return false if the
   engagement could not be found with the provided parameters, or if the engagement is not active.
