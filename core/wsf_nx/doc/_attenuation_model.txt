*****

This model determines the attenuation factor using the atmospheric absorption model from the ESAMS/ALARM/RADGUNS Common Environment (EARCE). This is a collection of precomputed tables which are valid for frequencies in the range 100 MHz to 18 GHz and 27 GHz to 40 GHz. Frequencies less than 100 MHz will assume 100 MHz. Frequencies between 18 GHz and 27 GHz and above 40 GHz will use a very computationally-intensive method to determine the attenuation and should be avoided.

.. note::
  This selection is valid only where either the transmitter or the target are on (or are very near) the surface.
