Overview
~~~~~~~~

This document provides a basic description of the moving target indication (MTI) implementation in WSF for a :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`. It was largely based on an existing implementation in ALARM.

The MTI signal processor block can be defined as part of a :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`. Note that the radar must have PRF (or PRI) specified. The input names and types are set up to mimic the ALARM inputs.

MTI Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MTI response is forced to be greater than the "mti_min_response", 0.0 dB by default.

Applied to a Sensor Interaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the :command:`sensor` detection result has a transmitter and a MTI signal processor the MTI response will be computed.
The MTI response then applied to the result's received power, clutter power, and noise jammer power:

* Result received power = Result received power * MTI target response
* Result clutter power = Result clutter power * MTI clutter response
* Result noise jammer power = Result noise jammer power * MTI noise jamming response
* Result pulse jammer power = Result pulse jammer power * MTI noise jamming response
* Result coherent jammer power = Result coherent jammer power * MTI coherent jamming response

MTI Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. command:: mti_switch <boolean-value>

   Switch for Moving Target Indicator (MTI) effects being applied or not.

  **Default** on

.. command:: mti_num_delays <integer-value>

   Specifies the Number of MTI delay lines.Must be greater than 0.

.. command:: mti_min_response <power-value>

   Specifies the minimum power response of the MTI system, floor value of the MTI power response.

   **Default** 0.0 dB

.. command:: mti_num_gates <integer-value>

   Specifies the number of MTI gates. Must be between in the range of 1-4. If 0 MTI is off.

.. command:: mti_range_limits <integer-value> <length-value> <length-value>

   Specifies the MTI gate minimum and maximum range for the Ith MTI gate.

   .. note::

      MTI processing is performed between the minimum and maximum gate ranges. No MTI processing is performed outside of
      the MTI gates.

.. command:: mti_angle_limits <integer-value> <angle-value> <angle-value>

   Specifies the MTI gate minimum and maximum azimuth for the Ith MTI gate.

   .. note::

      MTI processing is performed between the minimum and maximum gate angles. No MTI processing is performed outside of the MTI gates.

.. command:: filtered_doppler_speed
.. command:: unfiltered_doppler_speed

   Specifies if the ownship velocity is removed from the Doppler speed computation. A MTI sensor would typically employ **filtered_doppler_speed**.

   Default: filtered_doppler_speed

.. command:: debug

   Presence of this flag indicates the MTI Signal Processor will output additional operational messages to the system console.

.. NonExportable
