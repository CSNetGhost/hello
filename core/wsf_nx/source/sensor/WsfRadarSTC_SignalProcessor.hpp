//! A class derived from WsfSensorSignalProcessor that defines a sensitivity time control
//! processing technique for a radar sensor.
//!
//! Sensitivity Time Control (STC) attempts to adjust receiver gain with time during a
//! single pulse repetition period to get the best visibility of nearby and distant
//! targets. It is used to attenuate the very strong signals returned from nearby
//! ground clutter close to a Radar receiver. Without this signal attenuation, the
//! receiver would routinely saturate due to the strong signals. STC effects are typically
//! limited to around 50 miles, beyond that the receiver operates normally. Excessive STC
//! can blank out potential returns of low RCS targets close to the receiver.
//!
//! This signal processor is only applicable to radar sensors and was developed to be
//! compatible with the SUPPRESSOR method of STC processing. It adjusts the received
//! power, clutter power, and jamming power of a sensor detection attempt result.
