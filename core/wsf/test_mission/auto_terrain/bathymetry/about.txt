SRTM15+ V2.0 - Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) land topography with measured and estimated seafloor topography is an updated global bathymetry and topography grid presented using a spatial sampling interval of 15 arc sec. The bathymetry is produced using a combination of shipboard soundings and depths predicted using satellite altimetry.
