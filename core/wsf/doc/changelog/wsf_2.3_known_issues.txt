* The default utilization of mesh networks for comms, due to the higher fidelity comm modeling, can have performance considerations in very large scenarios or poorly demarcated network assignments. This is especially true if only the default network is used. Other networks are suitable for alleviating this issue, and a better performing, lower fidelity mesh network is planned for a future version of AFSIM.
* Network assignment for comms, when only specified via the network object, is currently not available until the next release.
