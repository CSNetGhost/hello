* **(2.5.1)** Corrected potential security vulnerabilities and other issues identified through static code analysis, including buffer overflows, insecure randomness, unreleased resources, use after free, memory leaks, and type mismatches.
* Added output warnings for comm methods called from an improper context prior to comm framework initialization. *(Issue #1546)*
* The previously deprecated doe_worker and doe_start tools have been removed from the distribution. A new Python-based matrix execution script, Chugger, is available under analyst ``tools``, and serves as an alternative to PIANO and other DoE tools. *(Issue #1586)*
* AFSIM installers have been updated to use a platform native installation location and a more conventional naming scheme on Linux. *(ELSZ #125)*
* The *bridge* command has been removed from comm objects. This functionality is now available for all comm interfaces assigned to the same :command:`router`. *(Issue #1310)*
* Multiple comm and message observers have had their signatures modified to remove redundant parameters and ease use. See :command:`observer` for details. (*Issue #1310)*
* Routers no longer have commands available to designate truth vs. perception modes. The :command:`router_protocol` now models truth or perception based on its implementation, which the user can control by adding or removing such protocols. *(Issue #1310)*
* The :model:`WSF_COMM_PROTOCOL_IGMP` no longer has multicast level designation commands. This is now set internally in AFSIM based on the presence or absence of required multicasting protocols. *(Issue #1310)*
