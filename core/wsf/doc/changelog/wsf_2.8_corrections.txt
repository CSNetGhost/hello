* **(2.8.2)** :model:`WSF_KINEMATIC_MOVER` now correctly reports acceleration. (:issue:`AFSIM-1730`)
* **(2.8.2)** :model:`WSF_KINEMATIC_MOVER` now correctly reports velocity vector. (:issue:`AFSIM-1729`)
* **(2.8.2)** Fixed an issue where :model:`WSF_TSPI_MOVER` :command:`WSF_TSPI_MOVER.relocate_and_rotate` used a spherical earth model instead of an ellipsoidal earth. (:issue:`AFSIM-177`)
* **(2.8.2)** Fixed an issue where a :model:`WSF_TSPI_MOVER` would always report 0 heading after a :command:`WSF_TSPI_MOVER.relocate_and_rotate` command. (:issue:`AFSIM-730`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected the return value of script methods :method:`WsfSimulation.ExecuteAtTime`, :method:`WsfPlatform.ExecuteAtTime`, and :method:`WsfProcessor.ExecuteAtTime` to indicate whether the supplied script is valid. (:issue:`AFSIM-642`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected the application of :command:`sensor_mode.range_error_sigma` value to the track measurement when *percent_of_true_range* is specified. (:issue:`AFSIM-1151`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue where platforms with :ref:`route<docs/predefined_mover_types:Route Types>` movers initially turned off will move along the provided route, jumping between waypoints, despite the mover being off. (:issue:`AFSIM-182`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue where platforms with :ref:`route<docs/predefined_mover_types:Route Types>` movers initially turned off and given a route, if later turned on using the :method:`WsfMover.TurnOn` script method, will cause the platform to jump to the location on the route as if the mover had been on the entire time. (:issue:`AFSIM-183`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue in the kinematic trajectory model for the :model:`WSF_TSPI_MOVER` that is used to predict future locations and time of apogee. (:issue:`AFSIM-167`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue in :method:`LocationValid2D()<WsfTrack.LocationValid2D>` that caused some tracks with known 3-D location information to report false for this method and true for :method:`LocationValid()<WsfTrack.LocationValid>`.  Clarified documentation for these methods. (:issue:`AFSIM-209`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue where :model:`WSF_TABULAR_ATTENUATION` was limiting attenuation values to the range [0, 1] absolute. (:issue:`AFSIM-172`)

* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue where converting MGRS coordinates to Latitude/Longitude would fail in certain cases. (:issue:`AFSIM-1039`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected a crash when using :method:`ProcessInput()<WsfObject.ProcessInput>` on a command that depends on other input that has not been loaded. For example, a route referenced in the :command:`_.route_mover.use_route` command must be loaded or the scenario crashed. A :command:`console_output` Info message will get issued when using the ProcessInput script method on a command with dependencies. (:issue:`AFSIM-1071`)
* **(2.8.1)** Added missing documentation for :ref:`signal_processor.mti_processor` commands :command:`signal_processor.mti_processor.filtered_doppler_speed` and :command:`signal_processor.mti_processor.unfiltered_doppler_speed`. Added commands to the grammar for correct parsing in Wizard. (:issue:`AFSIM-1073`)
* **(2.8.1)** Fixed crash that could occur when sending a :class:`WsfDraw` command over XIO. (:issue:`AFSIM-1097`)

* **(2.8.1)** Added warnings when using various zone commands on zone shapes they are not intended for. (:issue:`AFSIM-1119`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue where :doc:`Advanced Behavior Tree<../advanced_behavior_tree>` Shared Blackboard script commands would not propagate all the way up the tree. (:issue:`AFSIM-1234`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue causing :command:`advanced_behavior_tree.priority_selector` to not work with :command:`advanced_behavior_tree.root_node_type` on :doc:`Advanced Behavior Trees<../advanced_behavior_tree>`.  Also fixed crashes involving :command:`advanced_behavior_tree.root_node_type` with :command:`advanced_behavior_tree.sequence_with_memory`/:command:`advanced_behavior_tree.selector_with_memory` nodes. (:issue:`AFSIM-1241`)
* **(2.8.1)** Fixed the propulsion DIS appearance mask and added missing air domain flags. (:issue:`AFSIM-1209`)
* **(2.8.1)** Fixed crash that could occur when :command:`osm_traffic` vehicles are changing lanes to an unoccupied neighboring lane. (:issue:`AFSIM-1132`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue in which using the script method :method:`Array\<T\>.Insert` would result in a script compilation error if T was not an :class:`Object`. (:issue:`AFSIM-1394`)
* **(2.8.1)** Fixed an issue with the Record Length in the DIS Record Specification. (:issue:`AFSIM-1395`)
* Corrected an issue where the wrong reason was provided in :command:`event_output` for the failure of a :command:`behavior_tree` node to execute when calling the :method:`WsfBehaviorTreeNode.Failure` method multiple times. (:issue:`AFSIM-99`)
* Corrected an issue where the script method :method:`WsfZoneRouteFinder.AvoidZone` would not add the specified zone to the list of avoidance zones. (:issue:`AFSIM-163`)
* :command:`road_traffic` is now generated on Monte Carlo iterations of a simulation. (:issue:`AFSIM-168`)
* Corrected small inaccuracies in dead-reckoning when using a high-update rate. (:issue:`AFSIM-524`)
* Corrected an issue in which brace initialization (``= {}``) on non-constructible script types resulted in null objects. Brace initialization for non-constructible types is now a script compiler error.
* Corrected an issue where a platform with SELF as a :command:`platform.commander` on a named :ref:`command chain<Command_Chains>` would have no commander on the default command chain instead of SELF as the commander. (:issue:`AFSIM-127`)
* Corrected issues when using platform types with a :model:`WSF_ROAD_MOVER` in a :command:`road_traffic` block. If the :command:`WSF_ROAD_MOVER.off_road_speed` was explicitly set, then these platforms were always traveling at the off-road speed even when on the road network. Additionally, these platforms were not using the speeds specified in the :command:`road_traffic` block. (:issue:`AFSIM-151`)
* Corrected an issue where the path computer, used by waypoint mover types, was not correctly calculating the turn radius when applying the :command:`_.route_mover.body_g_limit` constraint. The error was causing the calculated turn radius to be larger than expected. (:issue:`AFSIM-301`)
* Corrected deficiencies identified with the documentation of :class:`Quaternion` script methods. Removed the undocumented methods GetPsi(), GetTheta(), and GetPhi(), as these have been deprecated. The :method:`Quaternion.Psi`, :method:`Quaternion.Theta`, and :method:`Quaternion.Phi` methods were incorrectly returning angles in radians and now return angles in degrees. The documentation has been updated accordingly. (:issue:`AFSIM-308`)
* Corrected an issue where :command:`comm` messages between simulations were unreliable when more than two simulations were connected over DIS. (:issue:`AFSIM-322`)(:issue:`AFSIM-323`)
* Corrected an issue with checking terrain masking when using the :command:`terrain.use_fast_masking_check` option. The algorithm was going one step too far, checking behind the target. This results in false-positives of terrain masking when line-of-sight isn't actually blocked. (:issue:`AFSIM-608`)
* Prevent the mover from being swapped when :method:`WsfPlatform.SwapMover` is called on an externally moved platform. This prevents external simulations controlling a platform's movement via DIS Entity State PDUs from losing control of the platform's movement. (:issue:`AFSIM-725`)
* Correct an issue with the Lambert orbital targeting solver that would lead to incorrect solutions for some hyperbolic transfers. (:issue:`AFSIM-908`)
* Changed the time used in the lunar model from UT1 to TT. (:issue:`AFSIM-886`)
* Corrected a crash when calling :method:`WsfXIO.Subscribe`, :method:`WsfXIO_PublishKey.Field`, or :method:`WsfXIO_PublishKey.ToString` from script. (:issue:`AFSIM-951`)
