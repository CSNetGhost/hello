* **(Issue #768)** The eventpipe was modified to automatically reuse platform indices of entities with shared names when they come from an external simulation.
* **(Issue #718)** :method:`WsfTrackManager.AddTrackReport` now returns the associated :class:`local track<WsfLocalTrack>` that was either fused with or copied from the provided track report.
* **(Issue #750)** Introduced the :class:`WsfNetwork` commands, and various :ref:`Predefined_Network_Types`. These objects now provide various basic topologies, as well as a fully user defined and linked network type, for greater flexibility in how comm objects are added, removed, and communicate within AFSIM. Introduced the protocol framework, and provided multiple updates for generally increased comm fidelity.
* **(Issue #499)** :ref:`Zone-based_attenuation` is now supported for simple polygonal :command:`zones<zone>` using :command:`modifier<zone.modifier>` inputs.
* **(Issue #216)** The :command:`sector scan<scheduler_type.sector_scan>` sensor scheduler now supports scans that span the :math:`\scriptstyle\pm{180}` degree azimuth angle through use of the :command:`azimuth_scan_direction<scheduler_type.sector_scan.sector.azimuth_scan_direction>` input.
