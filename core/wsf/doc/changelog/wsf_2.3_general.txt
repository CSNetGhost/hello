* **(Issue #275)** **(Issue #750)** The internal framework for communications in AFSIM has been significantly reworked, resulting in a multitude of changes that can potentially require changes to existing input files for use with this version. A brief but non-exhaustive list of such changes are:

 * A multitude of new capabilities, such as selection of routing algorithms, protocols, and especially code based extension of OSI 7 layer communications implementations.
 * **Removed - WSF_COMM_ROUTER** routing is now an inherent capability of all comm devices.
 * **Removed - WSF_COMM_NETWORK** network membership is now captured with more robust (realistic) addressing.
 * **Removed - 'link_protocol'** command for comm devices. This functionality will be reintroduced in a later version.
 * **Removed - 'number_of_channels'** command for comm devices, due to link_protocol removal.
 * **Removed - 'relay'** command for comm devices. This functionality is now inherent in all comm devices, and unnecessary.
 * **Removed - 'retransmit_link'** command for comm devices. New capabilities make this command unnecessary.
 * **Removed - Multiple script capabilities** are now deprecated and unavailable, for example, the send unicast capability. They have been replaced by more appropriate calls for the new capability.
