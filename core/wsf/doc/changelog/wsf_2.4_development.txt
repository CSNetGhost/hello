* **(2.4.3)** Relaxed the compiler version check for compatible plugins on Windows (MSVC). Only the first two digits, indicating C++ toolset major number and binary compatibility, are compared to those of the host application. *(ELSZ #133)*
* **(2.4.2)** Refactored the comm initialization process for ease of maintenance and better performance. *(Issue #1389)*
* **(2.4.2)** Corrected the implementation of ``UtEntity::IncrementLocationWCS`` to compute the current :ref:`WCS<WCS>` location if it was invalid. *(ELSZ #214)*
* **(2.4.1)** Corrected an issue with source installation where the ``ConfigureUnitTests`` module was not installing the necessary CMake modules to configure GTest. *(ELSZ #163)*
* Legacy implementations of comms used a random draw for variability in the purge interval time for queued messages. This has been removed, so that the purge interval is exactly as provided by the user. *(Issue #1210)*
* Updated the ``UtRandom`` class to use the random number generation facilities provided by the C++11 Standard Template Library (STL), with Mersenne Twister 19937 as the underlying algorithm. The class was also renamed to ``Random`` and moved into the ``ut`` namespace. *(ELSZ #18)*
* Static methods in ``UtInput`` to define search paths for 'include' files and path variable substitutions (used by commands :command:`file_path`, :command:`reset_file_path`, :command:`define_path_variable`, and :command:`undefine_path_variable`) have been made non-static and now require a ``UtInput`` instance. *(Issue #672)*
* Refactored terrain classes to merge ``WsfTerrainInput`` and ``WsfTerrainInterface``. Also moved terrain classes into the ``wsf`` namespace. *(Issue #1017)*
* Changed ``WsfStandardApplication::CreateSimulation`` to return a ``std::unique_ptr``, to convey that ownership of the simulation object is passed to the caller. *(Issue #1178)*
* Changed implementation of :method:`assert() <__BUILTIN__.assert>` to throw an exception instead of calling ``exit(1)``.  This allows the application to decide whether it is appropriate to exit or not. *(Issue #1178)*
* Corrected an issue with configuring CMake variables specifying paths to demos and scenarios for installation. *(Issue #1013)*
* Upgraded precision of floating point members of ``WsfWaypoint`` class from ``float`` to ``double`` to allow for more precise calculations in the framework. All member variables have been moved from ``public`` to ``private``, and ``public`` accessors and mutators are provided. *(Issue #1173)*
* ``WsfSimulation::Complete`` is now called when the simulation event loop terminates due to a requested reset. *(Issue #1193)*
* Created classes ``WsfOneShotEvent`` and ``WsfRecurringEvent`` that adapt the interface of ``WsfEvent`` to take a ``std::function`` which executes upon dispatch of the event. *(Issue #1192)*
* Updated ``UtCalendar`` to support parsing of ISO 8601 formatted date and time values. *(ELSZ #120)*
* Remove deprecated usages of ``std::tr1`` namespace. *(ELSZ #127)*
* CMake configuration has been updated to use the default behavior for setting the ``CPACK_GENERATOR`` value, allowing changes to be retained. *(ELSZ #129)*
* Deprecated usage of ``UtScriptTypes::Register`` and ``UtScriptTypes::RegisterExtension`` with use of raw pointers. These methods now take ``std::unique_ptr`` to convey that ownership of the pointer is passed to the ``UtScriptTypes`` object. *(Issue #1273)*
* CPack configuration has been updated to allow a variant of the build name to be set at configuration time via the ``AFSIM_CUSTOM_BUILD_VARIANT`` variable. *(ELSZ #126)*
* Updated to Doxygen version 1.8.5 configuration and minimum version.
* Additional formats (.tar and .zip) are now supported for 3rd party packages. *(ELSZ #123)*
* Changed perfect comm behavior on failure to retrieve a message recipient to notify upper layer of transmission failure from the physical layer. *(ELSZ #168)*
