* **(2.4.1)** Added output warnings for comm methods called from an improper context prior to comm framework initialization. *(Issue #1546)*
* Updates to the core random number generation engine may produce slightly different simulation outcomes for regression testing in models utilizing random draws. *(ELSZ #18)*
* Updates have been made to :command:`_.External_Link_Commands.external_link` for full integration with the new comms framework. The input and behavior of external links has been modified. A guide for updating scenario input in light of these updates can be seen via the :ref:`Link_Update_Guide`. *(Issue #751)*
* Removed the file name suffixes (win_x and lnx_x) from the core applications. Also, removed the .exe extension from the Linux core applications. *(ELSZ #124)*
* Units are now required for antenna and signature patterns specified using :command:`Az-El-Table file<_.az_el_table.file>` input to remove any ambiguities. *(ELSZ #151)*
