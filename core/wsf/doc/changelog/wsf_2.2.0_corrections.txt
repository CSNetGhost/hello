* **(Issue #119)** The shortest path is not being found correctly when using a road mover on a route network.
* **(Issue #221)** Added :method:`LocalTrackList<WsfTrackManager.LocalTrackList>` to :class:`WsfTrackManager` to also get the local track list similar to the already implemented :method:`RawTrackList<WsfTrackManager.RawTrackList>`.
* **(Issue #236) (MANTIS #231)** Fixed issue with reading in and converting *byte* data size type unit.
* **(Issue #281)** Corrected an issue where the initial track report fused into a local track was not being saved in that track's :command:`track history<track_manager.retain_track_history>`.
* **(Issue #309)** Removal of "default" and "default2" from :command:`dis_interface` and :command:`xio_interface` to enforce use of proper network interfaces and addresses by the user.
* **(Issue #332) (MANTIS #241)** When the WSF_MESSAGE_PROCESSOR queuing_method is set to 'none', the simulation would crash.
* **(Issue #333) (MANTIS #240)** The WSF_MESSAGE_PROCESSOR sender command implementation was not working as described in the documentation. The :command:`sender<WSF_MESSAGE_PROCESSOR.sender>` command may be repeated to build a set of acceptable senders. A message will be selected for processing if it comes from ANY of the acceptable senders that are listed.
* **(Issue #354)** The :method:`Zone<WsfPlatform.Zone>` method on a :class:`WsfPlatform` was not always returning the correct zone. This resulted in failures when using the :class:`WsfZone.PointIsInside` methods.
* **(Issue #355)** Fixed an issue where externally controlled DIS platforms were not properly copying over the DIS marking characters onto the representative AFSIM platform.
* **(Issue #362)** Fixed an issue with undefined geometry data in the **SENSOR_DETECTION_ATTEMPT** :command:`event_output` data when the transmitter and/or receiver was masked by the horizon.
* **(Issue #382) (MANTIS #286)** Fixed a crash in the :command:`event_pipe` when a sensor is used not containing an antenna.
* **(Issue #406) (MANTIS #235)** Miscellaneous grammar and documentation fixes.
* **(Issue #413)** Fixed a grammar issue with :command:`quantitative_track_quality` expecting a Real value instead of a Boolean.
* **(Issue #415)** Fixed issue with not correctly setting the commander when using the :method:`WsfPlatform.SetCommander` script method and not correctly removing a commander from existing command chains if that platform gets deleted.
* **(Issue #431)** Fixed an issue with duplicate mover updates calls for event-stepped simulations that were not required.
