.. command:: minimum_doppler_speed <speed-value>

.. command:: maximum_doppler_speed <speed-value>

   Defines the minimum and maximum target Doppler speed (i.e., opening or closing speed) capable of being detected.

   Default: 0 to infinity

   .. note::
       The mti_adjustment_ table documented below provides more fidelity in the modeling of detecting moving targets.

.. command:: filtered_doppler_speed
.. command:: unfiltered_doppler_speed

   Specifies if the ownship velocity is removed from the Doppler speed computation. A MTI sensor would typically employ **filtered_doppler_speed**.

   Default: filtered_doppler_speed

.. command:: debug

   Presence of this flag indicates the MTI Signal Processor will output additional operational messages to the system console.
