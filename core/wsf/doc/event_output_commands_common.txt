Commands
========

.. command:: file [ <file-name> | STDOUT | NULL]

   Specifies the name of the file to which the |EO| is written.
   If the file already exists, then it will be overwritten.
   The special name **STDOUT** indicates the |EO| is to be written to standard output.
   The special name **NULL** indicates that no |EO| is to be written.
   **NULL** can be used to cancel a file name specified in an earlier |EO| block.

   .. warning::
      The simulation will fail and |EO| will not output anything if the directory path provided here does not exist.

   .. note::
      To insert the run number in the file name use "*%d*".

   For example:

   .. parsed-literal::

      file_ |OUTPUT_FILE|
      file_ |OUTPUT_FILE_D|   //with the run number

.. command:: flush_output <boolean>

   Specifies if the output buffer should be flushed after each event is written.

   .. note::
      Setting this value to 'true' can result in performance problems because the output is written to the output file after every event.
      This should only be used when attempting to diagnose problems where the program terminates abnormally and the buffer would not otherwise be flushed.
      This ensures that the last event that occurred is successfully recorded.

   **Default** false

.. command:: disable [ <event> | all ]
.. command:: enable [ <event> | all ]

   Specifies the names of the events to be included or excluded in the event log.
   These commands are typically specified multiple times to select the events of interest.
   The commands are processed in order of appearance with each successive command selecting or deselecting events as appropriate.

   .. note::
      By default, all events start out as being disabled.

   .. warning::
      Be careful about using **enable all**.
      It can generate a lot of output and the addition of new events in the future could result in enormous amounts of output.
