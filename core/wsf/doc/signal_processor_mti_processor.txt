Allows the definition of Dual-Delay Line Canceler Moving Target Indicator (DDLC-MTI) signal processor. A target response is computed that will affect the attenuated clutter power prior to the final S/(N+C+J) computation is made.

If a simple MTI processor is desired, simply define an empty **mti_processor** block.

.. command:: maximum_range <length-value>

   Specifies the maximum ground range from the sensor to the target for which MTI processing will occur. MTI processing will be applied only if the target is within this range.

   Default: 0 meters

.. command:: interpulse_period_1 <time-value>

.. command:: interpulse_period_2 <time-value>

   Optional values that indicate the interpulse periods.

   Default: If omitted, a non-staggered MTI system is created with both values being the inverse of the PRF

.. command:: number_of_stages <integer-value>

   Specifies the number of stages in the MTI processor.

   Default: 1

.. command:: clutter_lock <boolean-value>

   This is provided for compatibility with the SALRAM model.

   Default: true

   .. note::
      If both **clutter_lock** and **upwind** are true, **clutter_lock** takes precedence.

.. command:: upwind <boolean-value>

   This is provided for compatibility with the SALRAM model.

   Default: true

   .. note::
      If both **clutter_lock** and **upwind** are true, **clutter_lock** takes precedence.

.. command:: filtered_doppler_speed
.. command:: unfiltered_doppler_speed

   Specifies if the ownship velocity is removed from the Doppler speed computation. A MTI sensor would typically employ **filtered_doppler_speed**.

   Default: filtered_doppler_speed
