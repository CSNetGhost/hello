//! A abstract base class for processor extension components.
//! Components can be added to implement additional functionality beyond what is provided
//! by a specific model. The responsibilities of a derived class include:
//! -) Implementing the 'required interface' methods as defined in WsfComponent.
//! -) Implementing any desired 'common framework' methods defined in WsfComponent.
//! -) Implementing any desired methods as defined below.
//! -) Implementing the specific capabilities required by the derived class.

   //! @name Generic methods.
   //!
   //! Actual processor model implementations do not need to worry about calling these directly
   //! because they are required to call base class methods that end up calling these methods.
   //! (e.g. WsfTaskManager::ProcessInput calls WsfProcessor::ProcessInput).
   //!
   //! These always have the same argument lists as the routine from which they are called.

   //! @name Model-specific methods.
   //!
   //! Actual processor models (e.g. WsfTaskManager, WsfMessageProcessor, etc.) must place calls in
   //! their code because there is no common location from where these methods could be called.
   //! See the static wrapper methods below.
   //@{

   //! @name Model-specific wrapper methods.
   //! These wrap the model-specific methods so specific models only need to have one line
   //! inserted into their code where component effects need to be evaluated.
