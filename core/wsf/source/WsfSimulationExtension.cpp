//! Called in response to a call to WsfSimulation::Initialize and WsfSimulation::PrepareSimulation.

//! A simulation extension will typically implement either WsfSimulationExtension::Initialize or
//! WsfSimulationExtension::PrepareExtension, or a combination of both. The main difference is that:
//!
//! - WsfSimulationExtension::Initialize is called only when a simulation is initialized after
//! being loaded from input files (the normal mode of operation).
//!
//! - WsfSimulation::PrepareExecution is called in the former case AND when a simulation is reloaded
//! from a snapshot.
//!
//! The primary criteria for deciding which method to use is to look at the extension and see if
//! it uses any external resources such as files or sockets. If the extension uses external resources
//! and wants to support snapshotting then it MUST use this this method so it can (re)establish
//! connections to external resources (A snapshot cannot save the state of an open file or socket
//! and so it must be reopened.)

// ================================================================================================
//! Called during WsfSimulation::Initialize, via WsfSimulation::AddInputPlatforms(),
//! after all platforms have undergone Initialize() calls.
//! This is called to allow any extension to perform processing that may be predicated on platforms
//! being added to the simulation, with all platforms and components having
//! undergone calls to Initialize(), but prior to calls to Initialize2() having been performed.

//! The simulation is in its pending start state, although the extension may also add additional platforms.
//! using WsfSimulation::AddPlatform.

// ================================================================================================

// ================================================================================================
//! Called in response to a call to WsfSimulation::Complete.
//! This method is used to release any resources (close files or sockets, delete objects, etc.) that
//! were allocated by the Initialize/PrepareExtension methods or otherwise allocated during the
//! execution of the simulation. No other events or observer callbacks will be dispatched after
//! this is called.
