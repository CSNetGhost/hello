//! A class that implements a queue where the work performed by the servers
//! is represented by a time delay.
//!
//! The caller submits an object of derived from Request which represents the work to be performed.
//! The request includes a specification of the amount of time needed to complete the work and
//! the definition of a method that is called when the request has been completed.
//! If a server is available then it will be assigned to that server, otherwise it will be
//! put on a pending queue for the next available server.
//!
//! To perform the 'work', the server will schedule an event for the completion time of the
//! work (time work started + time needed for the request). When the event executes, it invokes
//! Request::CompleteRequest to allow the submitter to detect that the time delay has expired
//! and to perform any actions associated with the completion. The server is then release and
//! will then be free to select the next highest priority pending request.
//!
//! This is typically used to implement the concept of 'thinking time' or 'processing time'.
//!
//! At the current time only a single first-in-first-out server is allocated.
