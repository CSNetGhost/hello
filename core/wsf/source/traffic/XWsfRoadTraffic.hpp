//! XWsfRoadTraffic provides a basic background traffic capability.  Based on the provided input
//! file a specified number of ground vehicles are created and placed randomly on the specified
//! road network (a vehicle density can also be specified.  Weighted regions can be specified
//! so that vehicles populate those regions with a higher density.  Vehicle type, velocity,
//! travel time, and quantity can be specified.  In  addition, vehicles can travel offroad at the
//! end of their route or runtime and pause for a given amount of time.  The initial number of
//! vehicles is always maintained, so as a vehicle is removed from the simulation another one is added.
