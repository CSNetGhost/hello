//! A 'association message' associates a track produced by a sensor with a tracking request.
//!
//! A request can be made to a sensor attempt to establish a track on an object using a cue that is
//! itself a track (WsfSensor::StartTracking). When the sensor acquires the target(s), it will
//! generate tracks. This message is issued by the sensor to indicate that a given sensor track
//! is associated with a particular request.
//!
//! In the typical case, the 'subject track ID' is the ID of the track that was provided to
//! WsfSensor::StartTracking and the 'associated track ID' is the ID of the track that is being
//! produced by the sensor in response to the request.
//!
//! \note The sensor will ensure that this message preceeds any message that pertains to the
//! associated track. In this way, a recipient will be able to correctly associate the sensor track
//! messages with the tracking request.
