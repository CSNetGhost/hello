//! An abstract base class that represents the operating mode of a platform subsystem.
//!
//! Many platform subsystems (sensors, interferers, radios) have a concept of 'modes'.
//! A mode would be specific set of subsystem parameters (frequency, PRF, power, etc.)
//! that would typically be selected by the 'operator' using some sort of switch.
//!
//! A derived class implements the actions that are associated with selecting and
//! de-selecting the mode.
//!
//! WsfModeList is used to maintain a collection of modes.
