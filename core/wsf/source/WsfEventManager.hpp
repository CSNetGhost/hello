//! A manager for a time-ordered queue (strict weak ordering) of WsfEvent objects
//!
//! This class is used by WsfSimulation to implement an event queue.
//! It could also be used by other classes that want to retain their
//! own time-ordered event queues.
//!
//! The event manager operates as a queue with ordering primarily dictated by
//! the indicated simulation execution time of the event. Events occurring at the
//! same discrete time are further ordered by a priority value. In most use cases,
//! the priority value is default assigned such that all events added to the queue
//! at the same time observe a first-in-first-out behavior. However, priority may
//! be modified to change the relative ordering of same-time events.

   //! The event manager becomes the owner of the event.
   //!
   //! Events added are ordered by simulation time. In the case of events with the same simulation
   //! time, events are then ordered by priority. Events with the same simulation time and priority
   //! are executed in a first-in-first-out manner via an incrementing counter.
