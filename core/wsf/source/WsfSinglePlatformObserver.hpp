class WsfPlatform;

//! A light-weight observer of a single platform.
//!
//! A object may register an instance of this class with a particular platform in order to receive
//! notification of the events defined by the virtual methods. Unlike the simulation observers which
//! receive notification of ALL occurrences of a subscribed event, this is directed at observing
//! a SINGLE platform. It is lighter weight and faster, but the user must take care to follow the
//! process described below.
//!
//! The typical use is to subclass this, define one or more of the virtual methods and attach to the
//! platform using WsfPlatform::AttachObserver(). Once an object attaches, it MUST detach from the
//! platform using WsfPlatform::DetachObserver prior to its destruction.

   //! Called after each mover update.
