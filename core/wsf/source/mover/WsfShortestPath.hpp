/**
   Determine the least cost path between nodes in a graph.

   This class uses the Dijkstra algorithm to determine the least cost path
   in a graph.  The graph is defined by a cost matrix with the following
   attributes:

   - A matrix element [m][n] with a value greater that zero implies that node
     'm' is ADJACENT to node 'n'. This defines an 'edge' in the graph with
     endpoints 'm' and 'n'. The value of the element is the cost of going from
     node 'm' to node 'n'.
   - A matrix element [m][n] with a value less than zero implies that node 'm'
     is NOT ADJACENT to node 'n'.
   - The matrix must be square.
   - The matrix must be symmetric, i.e., element [m][n] must equal to [n][m].
     (This means the that the cost of the path from 'a' to 'b' will be equal to
     the cost from 'b' to 'a').
*/
