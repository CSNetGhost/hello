//! A class which models a tanked quantity of fuel.
//!
//! This class models a tank of liquid fuel, which may be consumed from and externally refueled.
//! As a resource for a Tanker, it may feed fuel to more than one client (Receiver) simultaneous-
//! ly, but may receive from only one supplier (Tanker) at a time.  Preferred quantity levels may
//! be specified that indicate a desired refueling 'hysteresis band' of fuel to maintain during
//! ferry missions, when constantly in proximity to a Tanker.  Scripted responses may be defined
//! that react when a fuel level rises above or falls below this band.
