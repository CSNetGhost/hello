//! network/host assignments by the NetworkManager.
//! In addition, specific addresses may be tagged with an identifier. This
//! provides a uniform way of retrieving/querying addresses associated with
//! a specific use case. All addresses are specific, as in the addresses are
//! expected with a CIDR value of 32 indicating a single address, and not
//! a range of addresses within any specific addresses.

//! This namespace is dedicated solely for definition of string constants
//! that identify specific reserved addresses that are used for protocols,
//! hardware, layer implementations, etc. These can be queried for their
//! specific address from the ReservedAddressing object, via the NetworkManager,
//! via the sim object.
