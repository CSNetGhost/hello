//! network members or links, as well as the update method. In addition,
//! this class would likely benefit and be streamlined by the usage
//! of callbacks for advanced protocol interactions in the future.

//! Network object representations only exist in AFSIM as a container
//! to associate individual comms and their addresses together for

//! is extensible and can be instantiated via user input to aid in
//! automatic linking of objects within the network at the time of
//! of simulation instantiation for various topologies or other
//! behaviors that require additional setup.
//! @note This class SHOULD be abstract, but since we use it as a
//! generic type in the script interface, we're forced to allow
//! it to be instantiated. This class should never be used directly,
//! and only as a base for other implementations.
