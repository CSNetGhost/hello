//! Forward declare for ProtocolOSPF usage.
class OSPF_Area;

//! This is a generic implementation of some of
//! the features commonly associated with the OSPF routing
//! protocol. Usage assumes several operating conditions
//! that may be otherwise configurable in a full implementation
//! to avoid issues with complexity and performance in a mission
//! level simulation. Note that this protocol requires multicasting
//! capabilities, currently provided by the basic IGMP multicast
//! protocol, pre-defined and included in AFSIM, in order to
//! function correctly. Removing the IGMP protocol when using
//! this protocol will result in a lack of state sharing between
//! routers with OSPF.
//!
//! In general, this protocol provides some general
//! capabilities commonly associated with OSPF in a generalized
//! and highly abstract nature. These include:
//! 1. Using "routing areas" to define AS (autonomous systems).
//! 2. Limited sharing and updating states between routers to avoid
//!    excessive communications. (Still is performance heavy)
//! 3. Immediate distribution of network updates on update.
//! 4. Polling intervals for nodes (heartbeat for down nodes).
//! 5. Discovery and inclusion of new nodes (comms), assuming
//!    they are correctly configured.
//! 6. Re-election of BDR in the case of DR/BDR loss (we always
//!    promote the BDR to DR upon DR loss)
//!
//! What this implementation does NOT do:
//! 1. Attempt a full implementation of OSPF.
//! 2. Implement full OSPF data containers, link state messages, etc.
//! 3. Actually distribute routing data to every router. This
//!    implementation uses a generalization of routing data
//!    that is only contained on DR/BDRs, and other routers use
//!    this data for routing (instead of being shared via type 2 LSAs)
//! 4. Allow non DR/BDR networking types, such as point to point or
//!    most non-broadcasting network types.
//! 5. Neighbor relationships are not fully modeled. General assumptions
//!    are used to simplify the process based on connected interfaces.
//! 6. This model does not enforce timers to be the same between members.
//!    However, be aware that an excessive hello timer time beyond any DR/BDRs
//!    hold interval will cause that router to be dropped from OSPF.

//! The OSPF protocol defines an area as a logical grouping of routers and their interfaces.

//! that area to avoid flooding the network and streamline communications using assumptions held
//! constant across all OSPF enabled areas.
//!
//! This object is a representation of an OSPF area. Each area has a unique ID set by user input
//! (we simply use the existing address schema to provide this). Every network within the area
//! has a single router that collects the network state knowledge for the area, the designated router (DR).
//! It may have a secondary router with a copy of this data (to account for loss of routers) known as a
//! backup designated router (BDR). Since an area may represent a single network or many networks,
//! each area should have at least one DR, but may have many DR's, and potentially as many BDRs given
//! at least two routers for each network in an area.
//!
//! All areas must connect to a specially designated area, referred to as the backbone area.
//! Loss of connectivity with the backbone typically limits the range of communications to within the
//! the same area.
//!
//! Note that routers may exist in multiple areas. Such routers are referred to as an area border
//! router (ABR), and such routers will be members of the areas in which they border. Thus, developers
//! should be aware that a router may be repeated in multiple areas, and may have the same or different
