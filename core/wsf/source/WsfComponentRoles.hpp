//! The standard component roles.
//!
//! Every component type has one or more 'roles', each of which is assigned a number. These numbers
//! are defined by committee (much like DIS enumerations), with several guidelines as follows:
//!
//! - Numbers   0-199 are reserved for components that are part of the AFSIM core (directory 'wsf')
//! - Numbers 200-999 are reserved for components that are part of AFSIM but are located in other
//!   directories. These numbers are not published here for security reasons, but are agreed to and
//!   defined in their respective directories.
//! - Numbers 1000 and above are reserved for allocation to sites.
//!
//! A component may have multiple roles that it returns in the method WsfComponent::GetComponentRoles.
//! The first entry in the list is its 'primary' role while others are used represent other roles
//! in the inheritance hierarchy of the component.
//!
//! For instance, WsfSensor returns the following list:
//!
//! \code
//!    static const int roles[] = { cWSF_COMPONENT_SENSOR, cWSF_COMPONENT_ARTICULATED_PART,
//!                                 cWSF_COMPONENT_PLATFORM_PART, cWSF_COMPONENT_NULL };
//! \endcode
//!
//! The definitions of multiple roles allows one to invoke WsfComponent::QueryInterface to retrieve
//! a pointer to a specific interface.
