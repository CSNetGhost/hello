//! A manager for interactions between electromagnetic devices.
//!
//! This class is responsible for maintaining the data structures necessary to
//! support the efficient handling of interactions between receivers and transmitters.
//! In particular, it does two things:
//!
//! - Within each active receiver, it maintains a list of transmitters with which the
//! receiver could potential interact (has a compatible frequency).
//! - Maintains a list of all active transmitters and receivers.
//!
//! The methods within this class are called from within the WsfEM_Rcvr and WsfEM_Xmtr
//! classes to maintain the interaction structures.  Sensor and
//! communications systems that use the WsfEM_Rcvr and WsfEM_Xmtr classes must
//! follow the proper protocol to ensure that interactions between systems can
//! occur:
//!
//! - When a system is turned on, the system must invoke the 'Activate()' method for
//! each transmitter and receiver associated with the system.
//! - When a system is turned off, the system must invoke the 'Deactivate()' method for
//! each transmitter and receiver associated with the system.
