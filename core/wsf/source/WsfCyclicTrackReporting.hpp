//! An instance of WsfTrackReportingStrategy that reports all tracks in the
//! track lists once per reporting interval.  If the number of tracks in
//! a list changes during the reporting interval, or, if the reporting interval
//! changes, the time interval between  tracks will be adjusted.
//! @note Currently the implementation allows for duplicate tracks sent during a
//! reporting interval, if a track is removed from a list.
