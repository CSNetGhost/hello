//! This class derived from WsfMover models a low-fidelity (approximately) straight-line trajectory from a
//! missile launch point to target intercept.  The simplistic treatment does not consider mass properties
//! or Newtonian dynamics when intercepting a target track, but the benefit is that minimal information is
//! required from the user.  Two options are available:  1) The lowest fidelity approach assumes a constant
//! speed from launch to missile termination.  2) Another possibility is to specify a linearly-interpolated
//! table for speed versus time-of-flight.  If desired, a lateral g maneuver limit constraint will be imposed.
//! The target velocity (extrapolated by the expected time-of-flight) is calculated, and the missile velocity
//! vector is re-oriented toward the calculated intercept point (subject to g-limits).  If the missile and
//! target velocities are constant, then the trajectory will be a straight line to intercept.  As the
//! velocities change, the trajectory will curve in real time to re-adjust the intercept point.
