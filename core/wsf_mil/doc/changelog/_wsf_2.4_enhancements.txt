* Developed the :model:`WSF_LASER_TRANSCEIVER` model for laser communications.  The model provides simulation of acquisition times, energy propagation, data transfer rates, and ability to maintain links.  The model accepts typical inputs as used in laser communications system design methodology, such that a specific top-level system design can be tested at the mission level. *(Issue #835)*
* Added script class :class:`WsfGuidedMover` to provide a scripting interface for :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER`. It initially provides accessors to model-specific data. *(Issue #1137)*
* Added the script method :method:`WsfWeapon.ReloadInventory` which returns the number of weapons remaining in the reload inventory. *(Issue #1181)*
* Added a :model:`WSF_COMPOSITE_OPTICAL_SIGNATURE` model that extends the standard :command:`optical_signature` model by also providing the infrared signature. *(Issue #662)*
