* **(2.8.3)** Corrected an issue with :command:`WSF_WEAPON_FUSE.fuse_function_range` to allow weapons to detonate at the appropriate distance specified. (:issue:`AFSIM-1537`)
* **(2.8.3)** Fixed a rare crash with :model:`WSF_QUANTUM_TASKER_PROCESSOR` when using the :command:`WSF_QUANTUM_TASKER_PROCESSOR.allocator_extra_tasks` feature. (:issue:`AFSIM-2142`)
* **(2.8.3)** Corrected an issue when computing :command:`sensor_mode.range_rate_error_sigma` to reflect doppler resolution used in :model:`WSF_OTH_RADAR_SENSOR` and :model:`WSF_SURFACE_WAVE_RADAR_SENSOR` as a velocity instead of frequency. (:issue:`AFSIM-1325`)
* **(2.8.3)** Corrected an issue with :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` and :model:`WSF_UNGUIDED_MOVER` where :model:`WSF_EXPLICIT_WEAPON` caused unexpected headings when a nonzero initial velocity was provided. (:issue:`AFSIM-1974`)
* **(2.8.2)** Fixed crash that would occur with :class:`WsfClusterManager` when using H_TREE_AVG clustering. (:issue:`AFSIM-1313`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue where continuous- and discrete-fire implicit weapons were generating more hits or PK draws than expected during an engagement. (:issue:`AFSIM-206`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue with the :model:`WSF_PERCEPTION_PROCESSOR` providing incorrect number of available systems/resources on an asset platform. (:issue:`AFSIM-165`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected the issue of :model:`WSF_IMPLICIT_WEAPON` ignoring quantity, reloading and firing interval settings. (:issue:`AFSIM-361`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue with the :model:`WSF_QUANTUM_TASKER_PROCESSOR` incorrectly allocating extra tasks when using the :command:`WSF_QUANTUM_TASKER_PROCESSOR.allocator_extra_tasks` feature. (:issue:`AFSIM-1059`)
* **(2.8.1)** Fixed a crash when the :model:`WSF_QUANTUM_TASKER_PROCESSOR` purges multiple received tasks. (:issue:`AFSIM-208`)
* **(2.8.1)** :model:`WSF_BALLISTIC_MISSILE_LAUNCH_COMPUTER` can now compute intercept solutions for platforms using a :model:`WSF_TSPI_MOVER`. (:issue:`AFSIM-167`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue where turning optical sensors off and on that report to a :model:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR` with a :command:`WSF_IMAGE_PROCESSOR.filter` could cause a crash. (:issue:`AFSIM-838`)
* **(2.8.1)** Fixed an issue where the :ref:`docs/clutter_model:surface_clutter` model fails silently with low :command:`_.antenna_commands.antenna_height` used with a surface platform on rough seas. (:issue:`AFSIM-170`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue in which :method:`WsfWeapon.TimeToIntercept` was returning inaccurate results for weapons using the :model:`WSF_SAM_LAUNCH_COMPUTER`. (:issue:`AFSIM-153`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue with the :model:`WSF_TRACK_EFFECT` not applying the :command:`WSF_TRACK_EFFECT._subcommands.range_error`, :command:`WSF_TRACK_EFFECT._subcommands.azimuth_error` :command:`WSF_TRACK_EFFECT._subcommands.elevation_error`, or :command:`WSF_TRACK_EFFECT._subcommands.velocity_error`. (:issue:`AFSIM-660`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue with :method:`WsfAssetPerception.RelativeBearingTo` so that it correctly returns relative bearing instead of true bearing. (:issue:`AFSIM-1317`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue with the :model:`WSF_QUANTUM_TASKER_PROCESSOR` crashing during the evaluation step when the :command:`WSF_QUANTUM_TASKER_PROCESSOR.reallocation_strategy` is either static or event and the :command:`WSF_QUANTUM_TASKER_PROCESSOR.evaluator` is either distance or intercept_time. (:issue:`AFSIM-1634`)
* **(2.8.1)** Corrected an issue where launching a :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER` or :model:`WSF_UNGUIDED_MOVER` without a target track could use orientation rather than velocity when separating from the launching vehicle. (:issue:`AFSIM-1675`)
* Fixed issue where the mover of a weapon with a deferred launch would be initialized twice, resulting in invalid data. (:issue:`AFSIM-142`)
* Corrected an issue where the :model:`WSF_SAR_SENSOR` was no longer checking the resulting signal-to-noise against the receiver's detection threshold when determining probability of detection. The change occurred somewhere between v1.10.5 and v2.0.1. As a result, the electronic attack :model:`WSF_JAMMER_POWER_EFFECT` was having no effect on the outcome of a detection attempt. (:issue:`AFSIM-324`)
* Corrected an issue with the :method:`WsfEM_Interaction.SignalToNoiseClutterJamming`, :method:`WsfEM_Interaction.NoiseJammerPower`, :method:`WsfEM_Interaction.PulseJammerPower`, and :method:`WsfEM_Interaction.CoherentJammerPower` methods returning a value of zero by default. A value of -300 will now be returned for 0 power cases to be consistent with other EM interactions power query methods. (:issue:`AFSIM-390`)
* Corrected an issue where using :method:`WsfWeaponEngagement.SetPkDegrade` was ineffective if called from within the :command:`weapon_effects.on_weapon_target_engagement` script. (:issue:`AFSIM-895`)
