surface_clutter
***************

This is an algorithmic model that computes the clutter power. It uses the parameters from the :command:`global_environment`
for determining land formation, land coverage and sea state.

.. important::
   For :command:`surface<platform.spatial_domain>` platforms, this clutter model is intended to be used in ships with antennas of significant height compared to wave height (as specified by :command:`global_environment.sea_state`). In the case of low antenna height, other geometrical conflicts occur, and may produce undesired results.
