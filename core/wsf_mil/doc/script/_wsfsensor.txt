.. note::

   :model:`WSF_TASK_PROCESSOR` (:class:`WsfTaskManager`) also has a StartTracking method. When using a task manager, you should use its StartTracking and StopTracking methods to control sensor operations as it provides additional capabilities.

.. method:: bool JammingPerceived(string aMode)
.. method:: bool JammingPerceived()

   Returns true if the sensor (operator) perceives jamming as defined by the
   :command:`jamming_perception_threshold <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR.jamming_perception_threshold>` and
   :command:`jamming_perception_timeout <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR.jamming_perception_timeout>`.

   .. note::

      This method is only valid for sensors deriving from type :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`.


.. method:: bool ContinuousJammingPerceived(string aMode)
.. method:: bool ContinuousJammingPerceived()

   Returns true if the sensor (operator) perceives continuous (i.e., noise) type jamming as defined by the
   :command:`jamming_perception_threshold <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR.jamming_perception_threshold>` and
   :command:`jamming_perception_timeout <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR.jamming_perception_timeout>`.

   .. note::

      This method is only valid for sensors deriving from type :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`.


.. method:: bool PulseJammingPerceived(string aMode)
.. method:: bool PulseJammingPerceived()

   Returns true if the sensor (operator) perceives pulse type jamming as defined by the
   :command:`jamming_perception_threshold <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR.jamming_perception_threshold>` and
   :command:`jamming_perception_timeout <WSF_RADAR_SENSOR.jamming_perception_timeout>`.

   .. note::

      This method is only valid for sensors deriving from type :model:`WSF_RADAR_SENSOR`.


.. method:: bool IsEP_TechniqueActive(string aTechniqueName, string aMode)
            bool IsEP_TechniqueActive(string aTechniqueName)

   Is the technique with supplied name currently in use (i.e., turned on) for the specified mode if included?  Returns
   true if it is in use and false otherwise.

   .. note::

      If no mode is specified current mode is assumed.

   .. note::

      The EP technique active check will be for all beams on the specified/current mode. If any of the beams
      are active true will be returned.


.. method:: bool SelectEP_Technique(string aTechniqueName, string aMode)
            bool SelectEP_Technique(string aTechniqueName)

   Selects the technique with supplied name to use (i.e., turns on) on the specified mode, if included.  Returns true if
   successful and false otherwise.

   .. note::

      If no mode is specified current mode is assumed.

   .. note::

      The EP technique will be selected for all beams on the specified/current mode.


.. method:: bool DeselectEP_Technique(string aTechniqueName, string aMode)
            bool DeselectEP_Technique(string aTechniqueName)

   Deselects the technique with supplied name to use (i.e., turns on) on the specified mode, if included.  Returns true if
   successful.

   .. note::

      If no mode is specified current mode is assumed.

   .. note::

      The EP technique will be deselected for all beams on the specified/current mode.
