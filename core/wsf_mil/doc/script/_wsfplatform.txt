Subsystem Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. method:: WsfWeapon Weapon(string aName)

   Returns the WsfWeapon object with the given name.

.. method:: int WeaponCount()

   Returns the number of weapon instances on this platform. This is not the weapon quantity.

.. method:: WsfWeapon WeaponEntry(int aIndex)

   Returns the WsfWeapon object at the given index.

   .. note::

      0-based indexing applies.

.. method:: double TimeSinceWeaponLastFiredFor(WsfTrackId aTrackId)

   Return the amount of time that has elapsed since a weapon fire was last requested against the track with the indicated
   track ID.  NOTE: a weapon may or may not have actually been fired, this time is in reference to the last fire request.
   If no weapon fire has been requested, the return value will be less than zero.

.. method:: double TimeSinceWeaponLastTerminatedFor(WsfTrackId aTrackId)

   Return the amount of time that has elapsed since any weapon (fired from this platform) last terminated against the
   track with the indicated track ID.  If no weapon has terminated, the return value will be less than zero.

.. method:: int WeaponsPendingFor(WsfTrackId aTrackId)

   Return the number of weapon rounds that are in the process of being fired but not yet in-flight against track with the
   indicated track ID.  The reason the weapon is pending is likely because of a firing delay, firing interval, or salvo
   interval.

.. method:: int WeaponsActiveFor(WsfTrackId aTrackId)

   Return the number of weapon rounds that are currently active (in-flight, weapon platforms created) against track with
   the indicated track ID.

.. method:: int RoundsCompleteFor(WsfTrackId aTrackId)

   Return the number of terminated weapon platforms that were fired against track with the indicated track ID.

.. method:: int RoundsFiredAt(WsfTrackId aTrackId)

   This is equivalent to "WeaponsActiveFor() + RoundsCompleteFor()".  This returns the number of weapon rounds that have
   been fired against the track with the indicated ID. This includes rounds that are in-flight.

.. method:: int SalvosFiredAt(WsfTrackId aTrackId)

   Return the number of salvos fire requests that have been asked for against the track with the indicated ID.  This
   includes salvos that are in-flight, and salvos that were requested even when no weapons were left.

.. method:: WsfPlatformList ActiveWeaponPlatformsFor(WsfTrackId aTrackId)

   Return the weapon platforms (currently active & in-flight) fired from this platform against the track with the
   indicated ID.

Perception Methods

.. method:: Array<WsfTrack> PerceivedThreats()

   Returns the platform's perceived threats according to the perception rules setup in the :model:`WSF_PERCEPTION_PROCESSOR` :class:`WsfPerceptionProcessor`.

.. method:: WsfWeaponEngagement WeaponEngagement()

   Returns the weapon engagement object for weapon platforms.  Caller should test if the returned engagement IsValid()
   prior to using.
