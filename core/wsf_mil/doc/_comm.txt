Jamming Detection Commands
==========================

.. parsed-literal::

    comm_ <name-or-type> <base-type-name>
      # `Jamming Detection Commands`_

      jamming_perception_timeout_ <time-value>
      jamming_perception_threshold_ <ratio>
      continuous_jamming_perception_threshold_ <ratio>
      pulsed_jamming_perception_threshold_ <ratio>
      coherent_jamming_perception_threshold_ <ratio>
    end_comm

These commands are can be used to assist in the simulation of an operator detecting that communications are being jammed.

.. command:: jamming_perception_timeout <time-value>

   Specifies the time after which jamming that was perceived is no longer perceived that the perception of jamming will be returned to a 'false' state. If jamming is perceived again before this time has elapsed then the perception of jamming will be maintained 'true'.

   **Default** 0.0 seconds

.. command:: jamming_perception_threshold <ratio>
.. command:: continuous_jamming_perception_threshold <ratio>
.. command:: pulsed_jamming_perception_threshold <ratio>
.. command:: coherent_jamming_perception_threshold <ratio>

   Specifies the minimum threshold value that jamming will be perceived by the operator. Often used in conjunction with jamming_perception_timeout_, :method:`JammingPerceived <WsfComm.JammingPerceived>` script method.

   **Default** 380 dB
