Military Mover Types
====================

**Route Type Movers** - These movers are simplified movers in that routes with waypoints can be defined in order for
them to move from position to position during the simulation. Limits defined on a platform restrict their movement.
Platform movement is based on mathematics and not necessarily by aero or mass properties of the platform.

* :model:`WSF_SUBSURFACE_MOVER`
* :model:`WSF_P6DOF_MOVER`

**Follower Type Movers** - These movers become 'attached' to the Route Type Movers and are used to have a platform
instance 'follow' other platforms.

* :model:`WSF_FORMATION_FLYER`
* :model:`WSF_TOWED_MOVER`

**Track Type Movers** - These movers guide to a track and movement is based on aero and mass properties of the
platform. This type of mover is typically used on a weapon to define its movement in a simulation. Except for the
WSF_STRAIGHT_LINE_MOVER, mass properties, aero, thrust, and thrust duration must be known for the platform.  Resulting
trajectories from run to run can be significantly different with even minor range or velocity value changes of the
track that they are attempting to intercept. Three of the mover types are externally defined.

* :model:`WSF_GUIDED_MOVER`
* :model:`WSF_UNGUIDED_MOVER`
* :model:`WSF_STRAIGHT_LINE_MOVER`

**Simplified Ballistic Type Mover**  These movers provide a means to define either a parabolic or ballistic trajectory
for a platform.

* :model:`WSF_FIRES_MOVER`
* :model:`WSF_PARABOLIC_MOVER`
* :model:`WSF_TBM_MOVER`

**High-Fidelity Type Movers** - These movers are detailed movers that support physics-based kinematics including
attitude (heading, pitch, and roll) as well as altitude effects. Platform movement is totally based on mathematics
including detailed aerodynamic, propulsion, and mass properties of the platform. These movers can usually follow a
route of waypoints but also offer other control options.
