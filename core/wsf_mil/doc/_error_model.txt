.. _error_model.bistatic_error:

bistatic_error
**************

This error model still uses the sensor mode's :command:`sensor_mode.azimuth_error_sigma` and :command:`sensor_mode.elevation_error_sigma`.  Its function is to use the instantaneous measurement to calculated the dynamic range sigma.  This command is mutually exclusive with range_sigma, transmit_only, and compute_measurement_errors.  The latter command would cause this model to be bypassed.  This model requires a direct line of sight to *both* the transmitter (direct signal) *and* to the target (reflected signal) to get a successful detection.

The error model is based on paper "A Three-dimensional Bistatic Radar Target Position Measurement Error Model", R. K. Lynn.

.. command:: realistic_blurring

   Specifies to apply a Gaussian distrubution to the range error based on the calculated dynamic range error sigma.

   **Default:** disabled

.. command:: time_reflected_sigma <time-value> 
   
   Specifies the reflected time measurement sigma.  The reflected time, or scatter time (ts), is the time of reception of
   a signal that travels from transmitter to target and then to receiver.

.. command:: time_direct_sigma <time-value>
   
   Specifies the direct time measurement sigma.  The direct time (tx) is the time of reception of a signal that travels
   from transmitter directly to the receiver.

.. command:: transmitter_position_sigmas <length-value> ... end_transmitter_position_sigmas
   :block:
   
   Specifies a dual-key table of transmitter platform to the sigmas associated with their location measurement sigmas. 
   Note that the transmitter in a bistatic transaction can be on the red/opposite team. The key is a pairing of the side
   and domain.
   
   The format of the table is:
   
   .. parsed-literal::

    transmitter_position_sigmas_ *<length-value>*
        *#  side   domain   position_sigma_x  position_sigma_y  position_sigma_z*
        *   blue   land     10                10                10*
        *   blue   air      20                20                20*
        *   red    land     5000              5000              5000*
        *   red    air      5000              5000              5000*
