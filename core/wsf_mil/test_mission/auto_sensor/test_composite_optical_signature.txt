   # atmospheric_attenuation is a very simple-minded approach to modeling
   #   propagation.  It can also be thought of as the 'rate_of_extinction'.
   #   This should include the effects of scattering and absorbance.
   #
   # In reality the propagation would have to consider the wavelength of
   #   the spectral content, the scattering and absorbsion coefficients as a
   #   function of altitude and wavelength as well as environmental effects
   #   such as dust, humidity, etc.
   atmospheric_attenuation   0.05 per km

   # Background_radiance is a very simple-minded approach to modeling
   #   the background radiance.  In reality it is a function of many
   #   variables time of day (and hence, sun position), temperature, and many
   #   other environmental effects.
   background_radiance       500 microwatts/cm^2/sr

   # Set operating band of the sensor as one of following:
   #     short       1 -  3 microns
   #     medium      3 -  5 microns
   #     long        8 - 12 microns
   #     very_long  15 - 30 microns
   band                      medium

   # Noise Equivalent Irradiance (NEI) is the receiver noise.
   #    The ratio of computed 'signal' and this value must exceed the value of
   #    'detection_threshold' for a detection to be declared.
   noise_equivalent_irradiance  1.0E-12 w/cm^2

   # detection_threshold is the signal/noise required for detection.
