#     SA-10C (Grumble), Russian Designation: S-300 PMU Buk, w/5V559 Missile
#
# Defines an WSF 'mover' and for an sa-10c Theater Defense Missile.
# (The SA-10D and SA-20 missiles are very similar.  If no better data is
#  available, and you want an SA-10D missile, use the input file for the
#  SA-20 missile.)
#
# This file contains definitions for the 'mover', estimated signature data,
# guidance computer, fuse and lethality and a base platform type. The user
# is then responsible for:
#
# A) Creating a 'platform_type' that derives from SA-10C_BASE which defines
#    the missile seeker and comm devices as well as any other subsystems
#    that may be required.
#
# B) Creating a 'platform_type' that represents the launcher.
#
# The last part of the file is commented out and demonstrates the above steps.
#
# This is based on the description for the SA-10C 'Grumble' in Jane's.

   # Unclass sources say the guidance accuracy is only about 75 m, requiring a
   # large warhead to compensate.  The 195kg warhead is certainly lethal at
   # 65 m radius, even at low altitude.  This extends to a probable maximum of
   # 250 m at high altitude (due to thinner air).  Here we assume a high-altitude
   # detonation, so  use the larger numbers.  Pk's are estimates only.
