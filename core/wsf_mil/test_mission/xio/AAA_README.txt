This is used for testing XIO with weapons and task management.

- Modify run.bat to update path if necessary.

- 'run scenario.txt' runs the scenario without XIO (so you can see what it should
  look like.)
  
- 'run-both.bat' runs the scenario in two XIO apps. It should run roughly the same way.
  Part of the scenario runs in one app and part runs in the other.
