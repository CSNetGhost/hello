Most of the variables output by default are the same for both output formats. If you want to print only the default
variables in the default style (column output), you will not have to make any adjustments. If you want to tailor the
output to display specific variables, or to output in block format, there are a few PROGC variables whose values will
need to be changed. Some of these changes are common to both styles of output and will be discussed here. Changes that
apply only to one style or the other will be discussed in the appropriate sections. The following is a list of the
variables that may need to be modified. They are input with the PROGC overlay. Variable    Effects  Default  Notes FLVAR

output variables and FXVAR to add integer output variables. There are default output variables for the acquisition,
track, flyout, and search phases of the simulation. With one exception, they are all contained in FLVAR.

---------------------------------

These variables are stored, in order, in the input variable FLVAR(1) to FLVAR(54). See Section 5 for more details.

*** Flyout mode variables

The default output variables for the flyout phase are (in order) in FLVAR(101) to FLVAR(115):

TIME           Target flight time (SAMS run time)
FTIME          Missile flight time

FLVAR(116) to FLVAR(200) may also be defined by the user.
FLVAR(201) must be zero.

Note that the following Fortran formats are used when these are displayed for column output.
The first line is for the acquisition phase, second line is for track phase, and the third is for the missile flyout
phase. Lines 4-10 need to be defined if you are using the user output file option. They will be referred to as line
formats to distinguish them from the block and column output formats. (1X,F9.3,4F12.2,2(F8.2,F10.4),3(1X,F6.1),1X,A6)
(1X,F9.3,4F12.2,2(F8.2,F10.4),3(1X,F6.1),1X,A6)
(1X,2F7.2, 2F9.1, 2F8.1, F7.3, F8.2, 7(1X,F10.2))
(1X, F7.2, 9(1X,F12.2))

FLVAR is an array containing these output variables in specific locations. The acquisition mode variables are located in
FLVAR(61) to FLVAR(72). Track mode variables are located in FLVAR(81) to FLVAR(92). Flyout variables are located in
FLVAR(101) to FLVAR(115).  When you use FLVAR to specify inputs, you must specify the location of the first variable
that you are replacing. ESAMS assumes that any following variables overwrite the default variables in sequence. For
instance, if you were to include the line

flvar <103> xdot, ydot, zdot

in the input file, then the variables displayed for flyout will be TIME, FTIME, XDOT, YDOT, and ZDOT, followed by V,
GEE, and the rest of the following default values. If you want only the first five of these variables output, then
include a 0 at the end of the input line as in the example below.

flvar <103> xdot, ydot, zdot, 0

The 0 signals to ESAMS that it has reached the end of the variables that you want output for the flyout phase. Note that
the subscript for an input variable is denoted with angled bracket, < >. At least one space between the variable name
and the brackets is necessary. For output, you may choose any variable from the lists in Appendix C: Output Variables.
Also, you are not limited to only 12 or 15 output variables. If you like, you can output up to 19 variables for the
acquisition and tracking phases and up to 100 for the flyout phase. You just need to specify where you want to start
overwriting the default values, and you must make sure that there is at least one space in FLVAR between the end of one
list and the start of the next. For instance, if you include the line

flvar <73> hpanga, hpange

then the acquisition phase output list will include all of the default values with HPANGA and
HPANGE added onto the end. Also, this list ends at FLVAR(74) and the next list (for the tracking phase) doesn't start
until FLVAR(81), so there is definitely a blank value between the two lists.

You can define up to 20 integer variables for output by modifying FXVAR. You will also have to adjust PTRFXV. As with
PRINTM, PTRFXV has ten slots, one for each output file. By default, the first three correspond, in order, to the
acquisition, track, and flyout phases. PTRFXV tells ESAMS where in FXVAR to look for the start of the integer variable
list for each output file. Let's say that you want to print out the integer variable MASKED during the tracking phase
and the integer variable LOALT during the flyout phase. You can accomplish this by adding the following four lines of
input to the PROGC overlay:

Here the track phase variable is in FXVAR(1) and the flyout phase variable is in FXVAR(5). There should be at least one
space in FXVAR between the end of one list and beginning of the next list; in this example there are three spaces,
FXVAR(2) to FXVAR(4). The output will contain the default floating point output with the integer variables added to the
end. Adding the following lines gives the same result:

PTRFXV   <2>   1 5
FXVAR    <1>   MASKED, 0, R2, LOALT

These give the same result because the input logic reads in arrays sequentially; the number following the value put into
the second slot is automatically put into the third slot. The "R2" is a repeat count telling ESAMS to put the previous
value, 0, into the next two slots.

When you change the default input for the column format, you may need to change the line format of the output. This is
discussed in the Column subsection, page 51.

Sometimes you may not want to output the character variable STATUS. This is accomplished by modifying the values of
PTRCHV. Like PTRFXV, PTRCHV has ten slots, one for each output file. To turn it off, simply set the value in the slot
corresponding to the desired output file to 1. For instance, if you want to leave it out entirely, you add the following
to the PROGC overlay: PTRCHV 1 1

If an array is input without mentioning a subscript, ESAMS starts with subscript 1. This line tells ESAMS that PTRCHV(1)
and PTRCHV(2) are both set to 1.
