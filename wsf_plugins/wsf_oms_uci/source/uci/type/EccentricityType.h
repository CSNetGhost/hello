        * from being circular. A value of zero represents a perfect circle. As the eccentricity varies from zero to 1 the
        * ellipse becomes more "stretched". An eccentricity of 1 is a parabolic rather than elliptical, and values greater than
        * 1 are hyperbolas.; [Minimum inclusive: 0.0] [Maximum inclusive: 1.0]
