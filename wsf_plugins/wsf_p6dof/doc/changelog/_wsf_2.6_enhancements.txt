* P6DOF: Added support for sending P6Dof data through the event pipe to :doc:`view in Results Vis<../wkf_plugin/rv_p6dof_data>`. *(Issue #1646)*
* P6DOF: Added support for custom :doc:`event_pipe<../event_pipe>` data rates for P6Dof data in Wizard. *(Issue #1646)*
* P6DOF: Added the relative maneuver :class:`WsfPursueManeuver` allowing a platform to pursue a given platform. *(Issue #1684)*
* P6DOF: Autopilot now makes use of stabilizing channels. (yaw for bank-to turn, roll for bank-to-turn) *(Issue #1729)*
* P6DOF: SAS is now available as an augmentation on manual controls. *(Issue #1729)*
* P6DOF: Alpha (and skid-to-turn beta) feed forward has been augmented to account for shifts in CG and throttle position. *(Issue #1729)*
* P6DOF: :command:`aero_data` tables now support the use of "reduced frequency" instead of angular rate for the rate-based derivatives. See :command:`use_reduced_frequency`. *(Issue #1760)*
* P6DOF: :command:`aero_component` tables now include damping coefficients, including: cmq, cnr, clp, clq, and clr. *(Issue #1806)*
* P6DOF: Autopilot support generation previously reported failure if a vehicle was uncontrollable through at least one tested Mach number. Now, failure is only reported if a vehicle is uncontrollable at every tested Mach number. *(Issue #1986)*
