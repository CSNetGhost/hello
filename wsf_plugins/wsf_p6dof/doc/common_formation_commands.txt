Common Formation Commands
=========================

.. command:: debug

   Enable extra debugging output.

.. command:: detached

   For formations defined in the initial conditions, this will cause this
   formation to not be attached to its parent. After initialization any attached
   formation will have its members placed into the correct positions relative
   to the formation leader. The detached status on a formation also effects
   the way formation commands are propagated down through the hierarchy.
   See :class:`WsfFormationCommand`.

.. command:: offset <length-value> <angle-value> <length-value> offset_type

   Specify the offset of the formation from its parent. This is the means
   by which the initial relative positioning of the members of a formation
   is specified. The offset is given as a triplet of a range from the 
   reference point, a relative bearing from the direction of travel of the
   leader, and a vertical offset (or stack). For example, the following offset
   would be the point 100 m to the right of the reference point and at 1 m
   higher altitude.

   ::

      offset 100 m 90 deg 1 m fixed-altitude

   The offset type is either ``welded-wing`` or ``fixed-altitude``. A welded 
   wing offset computes its location based on the body frame of the lead
   platform. A fixed altitude offset computes its location as if the lead
   platform has a zero roll angle.
