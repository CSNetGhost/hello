The vehicles in these tests are intended to be as identical as possible to those used in the demos. To speed automated testing, the aerodynamic tables have been been trimmed to what should be necessary to carry out these tests.

For FA-LGT:
* Alpha is considered from -15 to +15 degrees.
* Beta is considered from -10 to +10 degrees.
* Mach is considered up to 1.5.

For FT-EXT:
* Alpha is considered from -10 to +10 degrees.
* Beta is considered from -5 to +5 degrees.
* Mach is considered up to 1.0.
