//! A maneuver used by members of a formation to attain and keep station during formation flight.
//!
//! This relative maneuver operates in three states: Form Up, Keep Station and Pursue. During
//! Form Up, the formation member approaches their station. During Keep Station, the formation
//! member settles into its station, and maintains station relative to its leader. During Pursue,
//! the formation member will fly onto the turn circle of its leader in cases where the required
//! speed to keep station would be too large or too small. See the implementation of the various
//! states for more details.
