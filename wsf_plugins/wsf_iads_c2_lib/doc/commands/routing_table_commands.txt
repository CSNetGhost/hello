Routing Table Commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Block for defining the HELIOS C^2 Dissemination message routing table.   
All values may have one of the following values: [peer | commander | dynamic | none].
* peer: Will send the messages to peers of this asset.
* commander: Will send the messages to the commander of this asset.
* dynamic: Will send the messages on the route to the message destination (for directed messages like assignments and assignment statuses).

.. command:: track_updates [peer | commander | dynamic | none]

   This command sets the routing for track messages.

   Note: Track message handling in AFSIM is generally handled by the track processing systems and not the battle manager components.

   **Default:** none

.. command:: assign_track_updates [peer | commander | dynamic | none]

   This command sets the routing for assignment tracks.

   Note: This is a directed message so will generally be set to 'dynamic'.

.. command:: assignment_cancel [peer | commander | dynamic | none]
