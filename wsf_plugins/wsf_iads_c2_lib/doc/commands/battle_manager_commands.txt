Battle Manager Commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: commit_authority <boolean-value>

   This command sets commit authority on or off. If the associated asset
   manager is not set to filter_dead_tracks, stale or invalid tracks may be
   assigned to a weapon. Additionally, unusually high or low purge intervals on
   track processors can cause unusual assignment behavior.

   **Default:** False

.. command:: project_tracks_by_delays <boolean-value>

   This command sets track projection by assignment delays on or off for
   assignment creation.

   **Default:** True

.. command:: project_targets_forward <time-value>

   This command allows configurable forward projection times of targets for weapon assessment purposes. Note that HELIOS defaults these depending on the model, but they can be overridden by this scripting setting.
   
   **Default:** 60 seconds
   
.. command:: by <time-value>

   This command allows configuration of the forward projection time increment for weapon assessment purposes.
   
   **Default:** 10 seconds
