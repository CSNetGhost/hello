Delays Commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
The delays block is for defining the Weapons Manager delays.

.. command:: time_between_engagements <time-value>

   The delay between assignment engagements. For example, if the weapons manager has two different assignments and both need to be engaged at the current time, when one will be engaged, this delay will take place, then the next will be engaged. Meant to serve as a way to prevent simultaneous assignment engagements.

   **Default:** 0 seconds

.. command:: expected_sensor_acquisition <time-value>

   The delay associated with expected sensor acquisition time. This delay allows battle managers to adjust assignment time sufficiently to optimize engagement shot timelines. Assignments will be assessed and created early by an amount of time equal to this delay, which allows the IADS to acquire tracks of sufficient quality to engage targets according to an optimized timeline.

   **Default:** 0 seconds
