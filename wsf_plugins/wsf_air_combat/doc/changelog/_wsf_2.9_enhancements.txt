* Added support in the SA (Situation Awareness) Processor (:model:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR`), to perceive missiles/weapons, improving overall SA and providing the means to distinguish between aircraft threats and missile threats. (:issue:`AFSIM-670`)
* Modified user-override script functions to use 'Calculated' instead of 'Calc'. (:issue:`AFSIM-670`)
* Added support for entity persistence and coasting time in the :model:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR`. (:issue:`AFSIM-1769`)
* Introduced runtime change capability for :model:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR` :ref:`sa_update_interval_commands` as well as a redesign of the event-based implementation of these twelve update types. All individual update interval settings are constrained to be a multiple of this base value. (:issue:`AFSIM-1356`)
* Implemented a new perception delay setting for :model:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR` that simulates human cognition by delaying a new track's transition to perceived entity status. Support includes the :command:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR.display_perception_delay`, :command:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR.visual_perception_delay`, and script method access. (:issue:`AFSIM-1362`)
* Implemented initial prediction capability for :model:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR`, including a "generic" prediction function and building-block primitives for possible anticipated moves. (:issue:`AFSIM-672`)
* Introduced :class:`WsfSA_PerceivedItem`, which represents a perceived entity or a group. A limit can be placed on the maximum allowable number of them which can be recognized by a :model:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR` at once. (:issue:`AFSIM-671`)
* Exposed methods for modifying and querying :class:`WsfSA_Group`\ s to script. (:issue:`AFSIM-671`)
* Added an :command:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR.asset_ignore` command to the :model:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR` allowing for categories of platforms to be ignored on the :doc:`ACES Display<../wkf_plugin/rv_aces_display>`. (:issue:`AFSIM-2111`)
* Added ability in the SA (Situation Awareness) Processor (:model:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR`), to set a maximum prioritized threat and target counts. (:issue:`AFSIM-2282`)
* Added ability in the SA (Situation Awareness) Processor (:model:`WSF_SA_PROCESSOR`), to Get, Set, and Reset cognitive limits. (:issue:`AFSIM-1670`)
