//! A  utility class for loading a FiresTable from a UtInput object.
//!
//! This could have been put directly in FiresTable, but it was decided to
//! keep it separate as the FiresTable is a nice compact class that has
//! some general utility.  This class, on the other hand, could get messy if
//! the ability to read different signature tables is added.  In order
//! to use these tables, one must be able to look up the (launcher) system as well as
//! munition type.  In DIS, one would look up the ammunition enumeration and the
//! firing platform entity number.
