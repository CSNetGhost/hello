//! @brief A class template for defining multiresolution containers for WsfPlatformComponent types.
//!
//! The purpose of this class is to define a multiresolution container for a WsfPlatformComponent. The
//! assumptions are that the container defines a family of models, each assigned non-overlapping fidelity ranges
//! (which are values between 0 and 1 inclusive). These fidelity ranges define the range over which the model should
//! be used when a fidelity value is given, currently only defined on this container, though in the future it may
//! be definable at other parts of a scenario.
//!
//! More specifically, the container can consist of one or more instantiations of its specific WsfPlatformComponent
//! (such as WsfMover) that are chosen from during initialization. The choice is made by assigning each
//! contained WsfPlatformComponent a non-overlapping <em>fidelity range</em>. The container itself then has a
//! <em>fidelity</em> and the model whose range contains the container's fidelity is used as the containing platform's
//! model. There is also an input available for users to forward input commands to all models.
//! @tparam DerivedComponent A type deriving from WsfPlatformComponent
//! @note Future enhancement may enable specifying fidelity at different input scope(s) than directly in the
//!  container. In other words, the fidelity parameter will be specifiable elsewhere so that specifying the model
//!  fidelity to use is simpler.
