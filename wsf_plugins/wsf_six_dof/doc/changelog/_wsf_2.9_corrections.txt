* Fixed issues in SixDOF PID controller evaluation that could cause additional process noise and report artificially high derivative signals for middle and outer loop controllers. Users should increase :command:`kd` for these controllers according to their outer and middle loop factor settings (:issue:`AFSIM-2110`)
* Fixed an error in SixDOF PID controller evaluation that caused PIDs to incorrectly track the sampled derivative rather than the filtered output. Users may wish to significantly reduce :command:`low_pass_alpha` values to recover previous behavior. (:issue:`AFSIM-2110`)
