Text Measure Output Commands
============================

.. command:: file <file-name>

   Specify the name of the file that will be produced. The directory into which
   the file will be created is inherited from the coverage object on which the
   measure of effectiveness is defined.

   If no file name is specified, a name will be generated from a combination
   of the coverage name, the measure name, and an output type-specific suffix.

.. command:: width <integer>

   Set the width of the output fields. Setting this value appropriately will
   lead to output files that are more easily human readable.

.. command:: precision <integer>

   Set the number of digits of precision to use when writing numerical data
   to the generated file.

.. command:: format <format-specifier>

   Set the format of numerical data. Valid format specifiers are:

   * **fixed** - The number of digits printed past the decimal point is fixed.
   * **scientific** - The number is represented in scientific notation, and the number of digits in the number is fixed.

.. command:: justify <justify-specifier>

   Set the position in the width_ of the column where the output is generated.
   Allowed values are: **left** and **right**, which place the contents of a field
   on the left or right side (respectively) of the column.
