* :model:`WSF_ACCESS_DURATION_MOE` - Measures the durations of access intervals of individual free assets.
* :model:`WSF_COVERAGE_TIME_MOE` - Measures the coverage time for the grid assets.
* :model:`WSF_N_ASSET_COVERAGE_MOE` - Measures how many free assets that a grid asset can access at a time.
* :model:`WSF_NUMBER_OF_ACCESSES_MOE` - Measures the number of coverage gaps for the grid assets.
* :model:`WSF_NUMBER_OF_GAPS_MOE` - Measures the number of coverage gaps for the grid assets.
* :model:`WSF_SIMPLE_COVERAGE_MOE` - Measures if grid assets have any interactions with a free asset.
* :model:`WSF_REVISIT_TIME_MOE` - Measures the revisit time for the grid assets.
* :model:`WSF_TIME_AVERAGE_GAP_MOE` - Measures the most likely coverage gap length one would find if the coverage interval were randomly sampled.
