/// @brief Interface required by a shared library
///    that implements profiling "hooks" for the profiling system.
///
/// For the interface that starts and stops the entire profiling system,
/// please see ProfilingSystem.hpp.
/// For the interface that identifies a region to profile,
/// please see ProfilingRegion.hpp.
///
/// The profiling system loads a shared library at run time.
/// That may be the AFPerf library that AFSIM builds and installs,
/// or it may be an alternate library.
/// The shared library must contain the five symbols
/// which are the string constants defined in this header file.
/// Loading a symbol must result in a function pointer
/// that is compatible with the corresponding function pointer alias
/// in this header file.
///
/// Using profiling hooks with C89-style parameters
/// (e.g., no @a std::string or other C++ types)
/// avoids potential issues with ABI incompatibility,
/// due to different compiler versions or C++ language versions.
/// The hope is that an alternate profiling library need not be built
/// with the same compiler version as AFSIM.
/// The profiling library should still be built
/// with the same compiler brand (e.g., GCC or MSVC) as AFSIM.
