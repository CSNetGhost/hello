/// Scope guard that marks a region of code for profiling.
///
/// This class' constructor begins the profiling region.
/// Its destructor ends the profiling region.
///
/// Profiling regions must be nested.  This implies that
/// @a ProfilingRegion instances should never be handled by pointer
/// or passed as arguments to functions.
///
/// Always name the variable representing the @a ProfilingRegion instance.
/// Don't just invoke the constructor without giving the variable a name.
/// If you forget to name the variable, then the region will close right away,
/// since the unnamed temporary object's destructor
/// will be invoked at the end of the statement.
///
/// Exactly one @a ProfilingSystem instance must exist
/// before constructing or destroying a @a ProfilingRegion instance.
/// That is, the lifetime of any @a ProfilingRegion
/// must fit within the lifetime of exactly one @a ProfilingSystem instance.
///
/// @warning Do NOT use this at @a main scope!
///   Always make sure the region is closed before @a main returns.
///
/// @warning @a ProfilingRegion should only be used by one thread at a time.
///    It's safe to have thread parallelism happening inside of a @a ProfilingRegion,
///    but it's not safe to have multiple threads creating @a ProfilingRegion
///    instances concurrently.
///
/// Here is an example of how to use this class in a function,
/// assuming that the function is only ever called within the lifetime
/// of a @a ProfilingSystem object.
///
/// @code
/// void InnerFunction() {
///    ProfilingRegion r("name of my choice");
///    ComputeStuff();
/// }
/// void MiddleFunction() {
///    ProfilingRegion r2("another name of my choice");
///    ComputeOtherStuff();
///    for(int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
///       InnerFunction();
///    }
///    ComputeEvenMoreStuff();
/// }
/// void OuterFunction() {
///    ComputeSomething();
///    MiddleFunction();
///    MiddleFunction();
///    ComputeSomeMoreStuff();
/// }
/// @endcode
///
/// This results in the following nested regions:
///
/// <ol>
/// <li> First instance of "another name of my choice" region, containing:
///    <ol>
///    <li> First instance of "name of my choice" region </li>
///    <li> Second instance of "name of my choice" region </li>
///    <li> Third instance of "name of my choice" region </li>
///    </ol>
/// </li>
/// <li> Second instance of "another name of my choice" region, containing:
///    <ol>
///    <li> Fourth instance of "name of my choice" region </li>
///    <li> Fifth instance of "name of my choice" region </li>
///    <li> Sixth instance of "name of my choice" region </li>

/// 1. Sections are allowed to overlap partially.
///    (This is not true for regions.  Given any two regions,
///    they are either disjoint, or one contains the other entirely.
///    This means that one can always map regions onto a single timeline.)
/// 2. Section creation happens separately from beginning a section.
/// 3. Section destruction happens separately from ending a section.
///
/// All profiling libraries shall let separate threads begin or end
/// (but not necessarily create or destroy) separate sections concurrently.
/// Profiling libraries shall make this thread safe at least.
/// As a minimum quality-of-implementation requirement,
/// they should not synchronize (e.g., via mutexes or atomic operations)
/// when beginning or ending a section.
/// This, plus (1) above, make sections the right idiom for timing events
/// happening concurrently on separate threads.  (We do <i>not</i> permit
/// multiple threads to begin or end the <i>same</i> section concurrently.)
