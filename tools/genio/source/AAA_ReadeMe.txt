The genio directory contains the framework necessary to perform I/O using ethernet
(via UMP), files, and memory.  The interface is defined in GenI.hpp and
GenO.hpp and is the same regardless of whether you are using ethernet, files, or
memory medium.  Typically users instantiate one of the following classes depending
on the desired I/O medium:

Ethernet, broadcast or unicast:         GenUmpIO
Ehternet, server:                       GenUmpIOServer and GenUmpIOServerCB
File:                                   GenFileI, GenFileO, or GenFileIO
Memory:                                 GenMemI,  GenMemO,  or GenMemIO
Null device:                            GenNullI, GenNullO, or GenNullIO


These helper templates are available and may reduce your coding:

Server call back helper:                GenUmpIOServerCBHelper
Input  helper (handy for dis classes):  GenIHelper
Output helper (handy for dis classes):  GenOHelper


The genio framework recognizes the type of computer it is running on and performs
byte swapping as needed.  The GenFile family and GenMem family allow you to
control the endian type.  GenUmpIO and GenUmpIOServer use big endian.  User control
of endian type could be added to GenUmpIO and GenUmpIOServer if needed someday.

The remaining files is this directory provide support of the above classes and
typically are of little use to the end user.  Of course you are welcome to explore
these supporting classes at your leisure.
