/// \file  GenUmpIO.hpp
/// \brief GenUmpIO
/// \class GenUmpIO GenUmpIO.hpp
/// \brief Provides a Ethternet transport mechanism via UMP.
///
/// \anchor receive
/// \anchor send
/// This class inherits from GenIO.  It uses UMP2 to manage the sockets.
/// This class supports UMP named sockets and the UMP agent names in a socket table scheme.
/// Sockets can be UDP, TCP, or Reliable UDP (RUDP).
///
/// This class can be initialized using the detailed constructors or the default constructor followed
/// by the appropriate Init() method.  Using the latter combination of default constructor and Init() method allows
/// the user to see the connect status via the return value from the Init method.  A successful connection must be
/// made before data can be sent or received.
///
/// To receive data this class uses the concept that data is first transferred into the receive buffer by calling
/// Receive(). Then the user calls the various Get() methods as needed to remove all the data from the receive buffer.
///
/// To send data this class uses  the concept that messages or data is "Put" to the send buffer for bundling and then
/// sent at once with the Send() method.  If the send buffer is full, the buffered data will automatically be sent
/// before accepting additional data from any of the Put methods.  Data is not guaranteed to be sent until the Send()
/// method is called. A call to Send() with an empty send buffer is harmless.\n
///
/// The GenOHelper and GenIHelper classes can be used when sending and receiving messages to assist in managing the send
/// and receive buffers.
///
/// There are several references to Reliable over UDP (RUDP) in this header file.  RUDP is too complicated to explain
/// all its details in this file.  See the UMP reference manual for the good stuff.
