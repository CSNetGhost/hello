/**
\defgroup init Initialization
\ingroup uto_ref
UTO allows options to be specified enabling, disabling, and configuring certain behaviors.
These options are set by calling the UtoInit method. UtoInit also performs other one-time
initialization that UTO requires for use. If UtoInit is not called, UTO will not function
correctly. Likewise, UtoTerm can be used when shutting down your application to cleanup the
UTO resources. Use of this method is highly recommended, but not mandatory.

/**
\defgroup rt_init UtoInit
\ingroup init
This is the UTO initialization function. This function must be called prior to creating
any UTO objects. This function initializes the run-time options, and configures internal
state for later use.

See the \ref rt_opts "UTO Runtime Options".
*/

/**
\defgroup rt_term utoTerm
\ingroup init
This is the UTO terminate function. Call this function to cleanup UTO resources. Calling
this function is optional as resources will be automatically freed when the application
shuts down. However calling this function may be necessary in some cases when the video
driver is causing an exception when exiting your application.
*/

/**
\defgroup diag Diagnostics
\ingroup uto_ref
Provides statistical performance information.
*/

/**
\defgroup entity Entity Management
\ingroup uto_ref
UTO provides entity databases to efficiently manage entity information. Entities have position,
orientation, traits, and shapes. When entity position or orientation changes occur, UTO takes
care of efficiently updating the visual scenes of all connected viewers. Entity shapes are
shared accross viewers so that access to the shape configuration is always possible.

*/

/**
\defgroup resource Resource Management
\ingroup uto_ref
UTO provides the resource database to manage a collection of external resources defined in resource
definition files. The resource database enables external control of resources enabling icons, models,
terrain and other graphics to be changed without recompiling your code.

/**
\defgroup shape Shapes
\ingroup uto_ref
The shapes in UTO range from simple polygons and lines to complex spatial history
and sensor volumes. Every UTO shape derives from the UtoShape base class. By design,
you shouldn't need to derive your own shapes, as UTO provides the building blocks for
you to build shapes that are more complex. Often, the UTO shapes provide everything
you need, but occasionally you need a way to draw custom images. The UtoGLShape provides
a way for you to specify a callback function for you to perform your custom GL drawing. In
other situations, you need to combine multiple shapes and treat them as one, for this
purpose the UtoGroupShape exists.

The visual capabilities in Uto are exposed in the UtoViewer class. There are symbols, camera, window,
world, and overlays. These components work together to provide the features necessary to build
interesting and useful displays.
