/**
\ingroup shape
\class UtoGLShape
\brief Allows for custome OpenGL drawing.

The GL shape is used to call a user-defined callback function for
custom OpenGL drawing.  The user-defined callback may be a free
function with the signature:
\code
         int Draw(void* data)
\endcode
Or a class method with the signature:
\code
         int MyClass::Draw()
\endcode
When creating GL shapes the "this" pointer or data object pointer and
function must be specified.  This information can be changed later
using the SetFn method.  For more usage information on using the GL
shape callback function, see the SetFn documentation.

It is important to note that the SetSize function must be called before
trying to show the GL shape.  Otherwise, UTO could only 1) always call
the callback even when off the display, or 2) think the shape has no size
and never shows the shape.  The current implementation opts for #2.

The GL shape extends the helper class UtoGLShapeBase.  This is done
solely as an implementation issue.  UtoGLShape makes use of template
functions to make type-safe method calls into the UTO DLL, and
UtoGLShapeBase provides the necessary workaround for the Visual C++
compiler.

The OpenGL matrices are setup for the current shape location and
rotations.  If the callback were to draw a point at 0,0,0 the
point would be drawn in
the center of the shape and 10,0,0 would be off an airplane's right
as compared to an aircraft model at the same location.
Refer to the MfcDemo sample, where the UtoGLShape is used to implement
approach plates (thought it currently isn't being executed).

Setting the color of a GLShape doesn't have any effect on what is actually
drawn, but the same color will be returned from the GLShape accessor
function.  Setting the transparency doesn't effect the geometry drawn,
but it does change the drawing order.  If it is completely opaque it
will be drawn along with all the opaque objects, if it is at all transparent,
the callback will be called depth sorted according to the bounding volume
compared to other transparent objects.

\note The user-defined callback function must restore the GL render
state back to its original state before returning.  Otherwise,
undefined behavior may result.

pointer of the class:

The value returned isn't used, it just needs to have an int as
the return type.
