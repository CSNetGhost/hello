The map definition preferences provide an interface for adding new terrain databases to the application.  Clicking on "Add New Map" provides an option to
add a new map.  New maps will take a file and a name.  Right clicking on a map will provide options to delete the map, or to rename it.  The
application will take `osgEarth <http://docs.osgearth.org/en/osgearth-2.7/>`_ earth files, which may be used to combine imagery and elevation data
to create background maps.  The italicized maps are built-in and cannot be altered or removed from the preferences.

Examples of maps built with osgEarth:

	:width: 30%

	:width: 30%

The map profiles section allows a map to be chosen for immersive displays (such as tethers or cockpit-views) and navigational displays.

.. note:: Units preferences are shared among all AFSIM visual applications.
