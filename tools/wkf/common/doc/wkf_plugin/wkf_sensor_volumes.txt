|SENSOR_VOLUMES|
----------------

Sensor volumes can be shown on the Map Display to visualize geometric information (Field-of-view shape, range, direction) for sensors and jammers.

.. image:: ../images/wkf_sensor_volumes.png

Visualized volumes will be occluded by the Earth's sphere, but not smaller features, like mountains, buildings, or platforms.  These occlusions are implemented as a visual affect to prevent beams from passing through the Earth; they should not be used to predict component performance.

.. note:: Volumes will not draw beyond 600,000 km.

Platform Options
================

Volumes are enabled/disabled from the platform options. They may be controlled at an individual sensor/jammer level.

Preferences
===========

The **Volume Type** will change what kind of volume is shown, these are:

* **Slew Limits**: Draw a volume that is defined by the :command:`slew limits<_.articulated_part.azimuth_slew_limits>` of the articulated parts.
* **Cue Limits**: Draw a volume that is defined by the :command:`cue limits<sensor_mode.azimuth_cue_limits>` of the component.
* **Scan Limits**: Draw a volume that is defined by the :command:`scan limits<_.antenna_commands.azimuth_scan_limits>` of the components' antenna.
* **Field-of-view**: Draw a volume that is defined by the :command:`field-of-view<_.antenna_commands.field_of_view>` of the components' antenna.
* **Beam Width**: Draw a volume that is defined by the :command:`scan limits<_.antenna_commands.azimuth_scan_limits>` and beam-width of the component.
* **Calculated**: Draw a volume that is calculated to show a combined volume of the above types.

There are the following controls for each configured sensor/jammer mode:

* **Faces**: This control will enable and color the volumes' surfaces.

* **Edges**: This control will enable and color the volumes' edges.

* **Proj.**: This control will enable and color the volumes' projections.

A user can define a new mode color scheme by clicking "Add" and entering the name of the desired mode.

Sensor Volumes for unset sensor modes will be displayed with the default mode colors.
