|VISUAL_EFFECTS|
----------------

.. image:: ../images/wkf_visual_effects.png

Two kinds of visual effects are provided: explosions and trailing effects. Trailing effects are only displayed in :doc:`Tether Views<../wkf_plugin/wk_tether_view>` and are based on the platform's appearance, which can be manually set using the :method:`SetAppearance<WsfPlatform.SetAppearance>` method. Types of trailing effects include:

* Contrails
* Rocket smoke
* Damage smoke
* Fire
* Operational engine
* Engine smoke
* Afterburner
* Rising smoke plumes

Explosions occur whenever a weapon detonates. A more detailed explosion is displayed in :doc:`Tether Views<../wkf_plugin/wk_tether_view>`, while a simplified explosion is shown in the :doc:`Map Display<../wkf_plugin/wk_map_display>`.

Preferences
===========

.. image:: ../images/wkf_visual_effects_prefs.png

From the Preferences page, a user can disable these effects, as well as set the scale and lifetime of the explosions in the Map Display (the lifetime of these effects are measured in real time, not simulation time).
