|ORBITS|
--------

The orbits plugin displays the orbits of space movers, and the Moon.

.. image:: ../images/wkf_orbit.png

Orbits will display in the proper reference.  This is changed by toggling the ECI Camera in the |MAP_DISPLAY_LINK| preferences.

Here are three images of the same orbit in an ECI frame, ECEF frame, and on a flat map.

Preferences
===========

.. image:: ../images/wkf_orbit_prefs.png

Fadeout (sec)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a platform changes orbit, this will determine the time over which the old orbit will fade out.

Color
~~~~~

Color may be set to white, team-color, color (randomly) by name, or by scenario. The "scenario" option uses the :command:`WSF_SPACE_MOVER.orbit_color` command in :model:`WSF_SPACE_MOVER` or :model:`WSF_NORAD_SPACE_MOVER` to define orbit colors. If a mover does not have a color defined, the orbit color will be the same as the team color.

Line width
~~~~~~~~~~

Sets the line width of the orbit in pixels.

Periods
~~~~~~~

When viewing an orbit on a flat-map or without the ECI camera (see |MAP_DISPLAY_LINK| preferences) the periods value will determine how many periods of the orbit will be displayed.
