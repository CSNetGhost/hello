Console Preferences
-------------------

The console font size, line cap, and coloring can be customized from preferences.

.. image:: ../images/wkf_log_console_prefs.png

Decreasing the line cap may provide performance improvements, but will limit the amount of history visible in the console output. The line cap does not affect the interactive output window or the "Export Simulation Log" context menu option.

Each color has 3 toggleable settings, a text pattern, and a color. If the pattern matches a piece of text in the console, that text will be assigned the specified color; the rest of the line will remain unchanged. Colors higher in the list take higher priority.

The toggleable settings are:

* (``Aa``) **Case Sensitive:** If enabled, the text pattern is case sensitive.
* (``|Abc|``) **Match Whole Word:** If enabled, ignores matches in the middle of words.
* (``.*``) **Use Regex:** If enabled, the text is interpreted as a Perl style regular expression instead of plain text.

A regex quick reference guide can be viewed by clicking the "Regex Help" button.

.. note:: When using regex patterns, multi-line patterns may not be colored as expected.
