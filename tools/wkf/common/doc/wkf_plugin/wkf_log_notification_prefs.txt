Notification Preferences
------------------------

Popup notification settings can be adjusted from :doc:`Preferences<../warlock_preferences>`. This page can also be opened directly from popup notification dialogs.

When enabled, a popup will appear for qualifying message types. Popups require user acknowledgement and are centered onscreen.

.. note:: Multiple popups will not occur simultaneously. Qualifying messages that occur while a popup is open do not create another popup.

Checking the checkbox will prevent future popups of that severity (error, warning) from appearing until the next time the application is opened. This can be set or unset from within preferences.

The "Preferences..." button will open the notification preferences page.
