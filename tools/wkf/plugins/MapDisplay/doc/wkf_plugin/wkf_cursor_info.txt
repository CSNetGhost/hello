The Cursor Info Dialog displays information about the position of where the cursor is on the |MAP_DISPLAY_LINK_FROM_CURSOR_INFO|. The information may be dragged onto the |MAP_DISPLAY_LINK_FROM_CURSOR_INFO| to create a data overlay. The overlays may be dragged around or closed using the close button which appears after hovering over the overlay.
