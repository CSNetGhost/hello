Clicking on the Add View button |ADD_VIEW_ICON| will add a new button to the tool-bar which, when clicked will recall the camera view from the |MAP_DISPLAY_LINK|.  Right clicking on a captured view will provide an option to delete the capture.

Clicking on the search button |FIND_ICON| will display the geo-search tool:

The line edit in the tool will filter the displayed list to entries containing the entered string.  Locations include countries and airports.  Clicking on an entry will move the |MAP_DISPLAY_LINK| to the selected location.  Right clicking on an entry will provide options to add elements to the location, or copy the location to the clipboard.
