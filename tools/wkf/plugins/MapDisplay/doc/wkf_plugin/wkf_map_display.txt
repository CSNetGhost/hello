The Map Display dialog shows the world along with platforms, tracks, and other elements the user has chosen to display on the map.

To navigate the map:

* Left-click-drag: 'Pulls' the map along with the mouse cursor.
* Mouse-wheel: Zooms in and out towards the mouse cursor.
* Double-left-click: Zooms the map into the mouse cursor.
* Middle-click-drag: Tilts and rotates the view
* Arrow-keys: Move the map
* Home-key: Reset the map to center on the scenario.

Platforms may be selected by left clicking on them.

Many screen elements will pop-up additional information when the mouse cursor is hovered over them.

Right clicking on the map will open the map's context menu.  You may also right-click on platforms to open the platform's context menu.

Platform Label Option
=====================

Labels displaying the platform's name may be applied from the Platform Options dialog.

Measure tool
============

.. image:: ../images/wkf_ruler.png

Measurements may be made by right clicking on a platform or location and choosing the measurement option from the menu and then clicking on another platform or location.
Selecting the ruler will show the options dialog, and deselecting will hide it.

* |draw_compass| Perform the measurement along a great circle.
* |icon_ruler| Perform the measurement along a straight-line.
* |icon_compass| Show the relative heading.
* |distance| Show the distance.
* |speed| Show the closing velocity.
* |hourglass| Show the estimated time to arrival.
* Select the font size.
* |dest| Show metrics on the destination end
* |source| Show metrics on the source end
