The Coverage Overlay tool displays :command:`coverage` data visually in the
|MAP_DISPLAY_LINK|. The tool works on :command:`coverage` overlay files,
which may contain multiple data fields. The data values are mapped into colors
using one of a number of available gradients.

Controls
========

This tool is available in the |VIEW_MENU_LINK| menu. The following describes
the controls in the Coverage Overlay tool.

.. image:: ../images/wkf_coverage_overlay.png

**1. Load Coverage File**

This button is used to add new :command:`coverage` overlay files into the set of
displayed files.

**2. Unload Coverage File**

This button will unload the selected file, and remove the associated visual
overlay from the |MAP_DISPLAY_LINK|.

**3. Loaded File List**

This list shows every :command:`coverage` overlay file that has been loaded
during this session. Next to each file name is a check box that can be enabled
or disabled to control the visibility of each file's data. The currently
selected file will be highlighted, and the rest of the Coverage Overlay tool
will be populated with the relevant options for the selected file.

Double-clicking on a file in this list will center the camera on the overlay.
This centering will only occur if the overlay is currently visible.

**4. Coverage Name**

This label will show the name of the :command:`coverage` object that produced
the data in the currently selected :command:`coverage` overlay file.

**5. Measure Selection**

This drop-down box selects which measure available in the selected file will
be visualized.

**6. Measure Type**

This displays the type of the selected measure.

**7. Measure Subtype**

This displays the subtype of the selected measure, showing the units for the
value being displayed, if any.

**8. Auto Scale**

Selecting this option will set the range of values automatically based on the
minimum and maximum values for the currently selected measure.

**9. Minimum Value**

This shows the value of the selected measure that maps onto the bottom of the
selected color gradient. This value is editable if the auto scale option is
not selected.

**10. Maximum Value**

This shows the value of the selected measure that maps onto the top of the
selected color gradient. This value is editable if the auto scale option is not
selected.

**11. Opacity**

This sets the opacity of the visualized data. The selected opacity applies for
any measure displayed in the currently selected file.

**12. Gradient Selection**

This drop-down box is populated with the available color gradients. The selected
gradient applies for any measure displayed in the currently selected file.

**13. Color Legend**

This displays the color legend for the currently selected field. This updates
with a new gradient selection, or when the range options are modified.
