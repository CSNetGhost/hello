/**
   This is a utility to compute inertial line-of-sight angular rates, and
   velocity pursuit and proportional navigation desired accelerations.  In
   theory, there are two possible ways of computing line of sight rates;
   A) Use a previous time-stamped value of target vector, and compute the
   rate of change from past to present, or B) using the inertial positions
   and velocities of the observer and target, and a vector cross-product
   to compute instantaneous angular rates.  Method B does not require a
   past value or time stamp.  (NOTE:  Method B was tested and not proven
   to function properly, so has been commented out below, until repaired.)
   The former method keeps past state, and so must be a class function.
   The output is a desired acceleration, which may not be kinematically
   achievable in all cases, and should be constrained in the calling
   application.  Functions are available to formulate the arguments
   as double vector/matrices, or vector class objects, but the underlying
   algorithms are identical in either case.  All input vectors must be in
   the inertial frame.

   NOTE:  Note the use use of the _VELOCITY_ frame for all acceleration
   calculations, not ECS frame.

   An available option is to set bias levels for horizontal and vertical line-
   of-sight rates which cause the guidance to take on a lateral or vertical
   curvature.  (Some platforms are often vertical-biased to preserve energy in
   the vertical plane, and some radar sensor models are able to improve SNRs
   if a lateral line-of-sight rate is flown to the target intercept.)  This
   option will not have any effect unless pro-nav is in use.  A positive
   vertical bias causes a depressed trajectory, pulling up into the target
   from below, and a positive horizontal bias causes the trajectory to bulge
   to the left, with a continuous right turn into the target.  These biases
   must be small, on the order of fractions of a degree per second!

   This algorithm does not consider any acceleration adjustment to oppose
   gravity sag, beyond a possible vertical LOSR bias.  If needed, this must
   be imposed by the owning application.
