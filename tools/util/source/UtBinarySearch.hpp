#include <utility> // Needed for std::pair

//!  A binary search utility.  This utility may be used to find the edges of a
//!  solution space, such as a minimum or maximum range at which a given object
//!  is effective.  User provides some evaluation function that accepts a double
//!  and returns a boolean.  For the search to succeed, the first guess supplied
//!  for the independent variable (IV) should be within the success region, or
//!  the search direction should carry subsequent samples into the success region.
//!  After bracketing the pass/fail region while moving in the correct direction,
//!  a binary search will quickly converge upon the cross-over point, to some
//!  desired degree of precision.  Current implementation assumes ONLY positive
//!  IV's are viable, as it halves the intervals toward zero when in a
//!  "decreasing" mode, and no lower bound (bracket value) has been established.

   //! Default constructor does not result in a ready-to-use object.

   //! Four-valued constructor yields a ready-to-use object.
   //! @param aFindMaximum True if desiring to find a maximum, else finds a minimum.
   //! @param aIterationMax Maximum number of iterations, after which considered failed.
   //! @param aTrialTolerance Acceptable error for convergence.
   //! @param aIncrementRatio Ratio to use to increase/decrease the current IV when
   //!     searching for the next edge transition.  Supply a number greater than unity.

   //!   selected by the user (with intimate knowledge of the solution space), or may
   //!   be the recommended value given by this same function in a previous call.
   //! @param aSuccessValue New success value (as a function of aTrialValue).
   //! @param aSearchFailed Value indicating the search was unsuccessful.
   //! @param aSearchConverged Value indicating the search has converged.
   //! @param aValueIsBracketed Value indicating the desired value has been bracketed (nearing convergence).
   //! @param aNextTrialValue Suggested IV value for the next Trial.  Note that when
   //!   aSearchConverged is true, aNextTrialValue is set to the best past success.
