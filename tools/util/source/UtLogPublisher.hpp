//! The console is a special case and is printed to directly from the Publisher.
//!    Data written to the console by the Publisher is also published as "raw" messages WITHOUT notes.
//! Any data written directly to std::cout, std::cerr, or std::clog may be captured by
//!    the publisher and sent to subscribers.
//! By default it is subscribed to PresetRelease (Fatal, Error, Warning, and Info).
