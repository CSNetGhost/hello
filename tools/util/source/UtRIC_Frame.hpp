//! A utility class that can be used to convert to and from the RIC frame from an inertial frame.
//! This class provides a set of static methods to allow use in cases where repeated transformations
//! are not needed.
//! The RIC frame is a non-inertial frame that is comoving with an entity that is instantaneously
//! specified with the inertial position and velocity of that entity. The frame uses an x-axis along
//! the position to the entity (Radial), a z-axis along the orbital angular momentum of the entity
//! (Cross-track), and a y-axis that completes the right handed orthonormal frame (In-track). When
//! in a circular orbit, the in-track direction is the same as the direction of the entity's velocity.

   //! Calculates the RIC values for a position and velocity with respect to another position.
   //! @param aPosition is the position of the entity relative to which RIC values are being calculated.
   //! @param aVelocity is the velocity of the entity relative to which RIC values are being calculated.
   //! @param aOtherPos is the position of the entity whose RIC values are being calculated.
   //! @returns The RIC frame offsets.
   //! @note  This function is normally used for a space mover wrt another platform,
   //!        but can be used in other domains as well.

   //! This will return the position of the of an object that has the given @p aRIC_Position relative
   //! to an object with the given @p aPosition and @p aVelocity. The reference frame of the returned
   //! value will be the same as whatever frame the @p aPosition and @p aVelocity are provided in,
   //! which is typically the ECI frame.
   //! @param aPosition The position of the entity relative to which the RIC value is given.
   //! @param aVelocity The velocity of the entity relative to which the RIC value is given.
   //! @param aOtherPos The RIC frame offset relative to the given @p aPosition and @p aVelocity.
   //! @returns The position corresponding to the given RIC offset.

   //! Transform the given vector from the RIC frame.
   //! This will return the given @p aRIC_Vector from the RIC frame into the frame used to specify
   //! the @p aPosition and @p aVelcocity used to define the RIC frame. The most common use case would
   //! be for the provided @p aPosition and @p aVelocity to be with respect to the ECI frame, and so
   //! this function would transform the given @p aRIC_Vector into the equivalent ECI vector.
   //! Unlike CalculateFromRIC, this function does not assume that @p aRIC_Vector is a position vector,
   //! and so the returned vector does not offset the returned vector; this functions acts as the
   //! identity operation on the zero vector.
   //! @param aPosition    The position of the entity relative to which the RIC frame vector is given.
   //! @param aVelocity    The velocity of the entity relative to which the RIC frame vector is given.
   //! @param aRIC_Vector  The vector in the RIC frame to be transformed.
   //! @returns The vector corresponding to the given RIC vector in the frame of the provided position and velocity.

   //! from the given @p aPosition and @p aVelocity, both of which are defined with respect to some inertial frame.
   //! The most common use case would be for that inertial frame to be ECI.
   //! @param aPosition     The position of the entity relative to which the RIC frame vector is given.
   //! @param aVelocity     The velocity of the entity relative to which the RIC frame vector is given.
   //! @param aRIC_Position The RIC position at which the relative velocity is needed.
   //! @param aRIC_Velocity The RIC velocity to be transformed into the inertial relative velocity.
