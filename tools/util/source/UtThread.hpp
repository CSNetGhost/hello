//! An interface to operating system multi-threading services.
//!
//! This class provides the ability to create and control threads.
//!
//! To use this class, the application must:
//!
//! - Create a derived class that implements the Run() method.
//! - Instantiate a object of the derived class to represent the thread.
//! - Invoke the Start() method of the object to start the thread.
//! - Invoke the Join() method of the object to wait for the thread to finish.
//!
//! @see std::mutex for a system-independent interface to operating system mutexes
//! (which can be used to control access to resources that are shared between
//! threads).
//!
//! @note Utilizes C++11 standard thread interface.
