//! side calculation.
//!
//! The DynamicState arugments are passed by non-const reference because some clients
//! might save off intermediate values during the computation of the right hand side.
//! Instead of this routine forcing the DynamicState to apply mutable to members,

//! The KinematicState is an object that contains the right hand side values of
//! the system of differential equations modeling the dynamics of interest. This
//! type must support scaling by a double value, and addition, making the type
//! act as a vector space (even if the implementation is not in the form of a
//! traditional vector). The KinematicState is the output of the right hand side
//! function, and is used as input to the DynamicState::Advance method.
