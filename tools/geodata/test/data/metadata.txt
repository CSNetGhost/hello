  Description:  
    Abstract:  The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was a partnership between NASA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). Flown aboard the NASA Space Shuttle Endeavour (11-22 February 2000), SRTM fulfilled its mission to map the world in three dimensions. The USGS is under agreement with NGA and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to distribute SRTM elevation products derived from the C-band radar data.  SRTM utilized interferomic C-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar to generate elevation data over 80 percent of the Earth's land surface. 

The SRTM collection was edited to delineate and flatten water bodies, better define coastlines, remove spikes and wells, and fill small voids.  Since some areas of missing data or voids were still present in the SRTM collection, the NGA  filled the voids using interpolation algorithms in conjunction with other sources of elevation data. The SRTM Void Filled data set are the result of this additional processing. 
    Purpose:  SRTM elevation data of the Earth's land surface are available with data points spaced at 1 arc second for the United States and at 3 arc seconds for global coverage. 
    Supplemental_Information:  Available Products:

SRTM data at 1 arc second (~30 meter) are currently available for the United States, its territories and possessions. SRTM data at 3 arc-seconds (~90 meters) are currently available for global coverage between 60 degrees North and 56 degrees South latitude.
  Raster size is 1 degree tiles.   The data are expressed in geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude) and is horizontally referenced to WGS84 and vertically referenced to the EGM96 Geoid.
Formats:
1. DTED - Digital Terrain Elevation Data is a standard mapping format designed by the NGA. Each file or cell contains a matrix of vertical elevation values spaced at regular horizontal intervals measured in geographic latitude and longitude units. DTED is a trademark of NGA.

2. BIL  - Band interleaved by line is a simple binary raster format with accompanying ASCII descriptor files. The BIL integer format is recommended for software packages that do not support floating-point data. 

3. GeoTIFF - Georeferenced Tagged Image File Format is a TIFF file with embedded geographic information. This is standard image format for GIS applications.
