# example_graph will read command chains from a provided AER file and generate
# a PDF of the entire scenario's commandchain network.  This demonstrates using
# pymystic, using additional modules, and pulling data out of specific message types
#
# It is run with python and a command line argument to an AER file:
# > python example_graph path/myfile.aer
#
# IMPORTANT: This example requires both GraphViz and the graphviz Python module
#            Ensure that the path to GraphViz binaries is present in the PATH environment variable
#            Ensure that graphviz is present in the lib/site-packages of the Python installation
