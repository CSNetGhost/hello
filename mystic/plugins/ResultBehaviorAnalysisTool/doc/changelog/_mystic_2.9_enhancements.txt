* Added the ability to right click and minimize a nodes children, as well as a way to view if a node is a tree, if it has its children hidden, and how many blackboard variables a node currently has in the :doc:`Behavior Tree View<../wkf_plugin/rv_behavior_tree_tool>`.  The blackboard has been updated to show :doc:`WsfTrack<../script/wsftrack>` and :doc:`WsfPlatform<../script/wsfplatform>` variables. (:issue:`AFSIM-977`)
* Changed the icon for Sequence nodes to a question mark and the icon for Parallel nodes to three arrows down for a more intuitive look in the :doc:`Behavior Tree View<../wkf_plugin/rv_behavior_tree_tool>`. (:issue:`AFSIM-1186`)
* Added a 'Center Tree in View' context menu option and precondition tooltips to the :doc:`Behavior Tree View<../wkf_plugin/rv_behavior_tree_tool>`. (:issue:`AFSIM-1298`)
* In the :doc:`Behavior Tree View<../wkf_plugin/rv_behavior_tree_tool>` composite nodes now will show their node type symbol when they are a tree rather than the root node symbol. (:issue:`AFSIM-1298`)
* Hiding/showing children will now collapse and expand tree layouts as necessary in the :doc:`Behavior Tree View<../wkf_plugin/rv_behavior_tree_tool>`. (:issue:`AFSIM-1298`)
