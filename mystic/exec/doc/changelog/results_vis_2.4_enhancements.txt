* A real-time option was added to the :doc:`time-controllers preferences<../wkf_plugin/rv_time_controller>`. *(Issue #774)*
* Added a scriptable interface :class:`WsfEventPipe` that can publish data to the :command:`event_pipe` for :doc:`visualization<../wkf_plugin/rv_scripted_platform_details>`. *(Issue #1012)*
* Improved :doc:`video captures <../wkf_plugin/rv_video_capture>` by using H.264 encoding on Windows platforms. *(Issue #1032)*
* Improved the selection highlight on the map to look better and be more tolerant of resolution changes. *(Issue #1104)*
* Add per message schema comparisons to better filter out incompatible event-pipe messages. *(Issue #1110)*
* Added the sensor name to sensor track interaction lines, and event traces. *(Issue #1123)*
* Properly scale vectors to the models' sizes in immersive views. *(Issue #1130)*
* Improved the calculation to determine the curvature of interaction lines to minimize the effect when terrain clipping is unlikely. *(Issue #1145)*
* Added the ability to display :doc:`vectors <../wkf_plugin/rv_map_annotation>` on the :doc:`Map Display<../wkf_plugin/rv_map_display>`. *(Issue #1152)*
* Improved the follow feature in the map view to better support the ECI camera mode, high altitude platforms, and rotations. *(Issue #1159)*
* Added a :doc:`look-at<../wkf_plugin/rv_tether_view>` capability to the tether plugin. *(Issue #1187)*
* Added platform history options (trace-lines and wing-ribbons) to :doc:`tether views<../wkf_plugin/rv_tether_view>`. *(Issue #1235)*
* Added the ability to plot by ground range from starting position. *(Issue #1239)*
* Added an option to display or suppress team colors on platform icons in the :doc:`Map Display<../wkf_plugin/rv_map_display>` preferences.
* Added additional settings to customize :doc:`Event Markers<../wkf_plugin/rv_event_marker>`.
* Added comment bubbles to the Map Display for the :doc:`Comment<../wkf_plugin/rv_comment>` Plugin.
* Added additional settings to customize :doc:`Tracks<../wkf_plugin/rv_tracks>`.
* Added :doc:`waterfall plots<../wkf_plugin/rv_waterfall>` to display periods of interaction.
* Added a file-open shortcut (defaulted to Control-O)
