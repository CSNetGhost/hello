* Fixed a bug where tracks would not populate their data on creation. *(Issue #1393)*
* Fixed issue where the :doc:`Event Marker <../wkf_plugin/rv_event_marker>` preferences would reset the selected icon to a Dot when the user would try to select X for the icon. Also fixed an issue where custom icons would sometimes fail to show up. 
* Fixed an issue where :class:`WsfDraw` icons would not show the requested color.
* Fixed an issue where :class:`WsfDraw` commands would execute prematurely when viewing live data. *(Issue #1207)*
* Fixed issue in :doc:`Map Annotations <../wkf_plugin/rv_map_annotation>` where adding a text annotation to a platform did not remove the symbolic decoration, already attached to that platform, in the :doc:`Platform Browser <../wkf_plugin/rv_platform_browser>`. *(Issue #1505)*
* Fixed an issue where attempts to plot heading would plot time instead. *(Issue #1577)*
* Fixed issue where modifications to :doc:`preferences <../mystic_preferences>` made by loading :doc:`configurations <../mystic_user_configurations>` from the :doc:`file menu <../mystic_file_menu>` do not immediately take effect.
* Fixed issue where including certain fields (E.g. Status) in :doc:`Map Hover Info <../wkf_plugin/wk_map_hover_info>` prevented information boxes from being displayed. *(Issue #1612)*
