* **(2.6.2)** Fixed a range check that was causing sensor volume to be drawn narrow with azimuth ranges from -180 to 180. *(Issue #2232)*
* **(2.6.2)** Added geometry to the termination surface of circular fields of view to make them more spherical. *(AFSIM-290)*
* **(2.6.2)** Fixed a crash that sometimes occurred when trying to plot data from a Sensor Track via :doc:`Platform Details<../wkf_plugin/rv_platform_data>`. *(Issue #2381)*
* **(2.6.2)** Corrected an issue that where detection stop events would not be sent went sensor turns off. *(Issue #2438)*
* **(2.6.2)** Fixed a crash that occurred when opening then closing the :doc:`Quantum Tasker Matrix<../wkf_plugin/rv_quantum_tasker_matrix>` in Mystic. *(Issue #2449)*
* **(2.6.2)** Corrected an issue where :class:`WsfDraw` ellipsoids would not have the appropriate color. *(Issue #2536)*
* **(2.6.2)** Corrected a bug that could cause a crash five seconds after loading an AER file. *(Issue #2542)*
* **(2.6.1)** Fixed an issue where RV would crash when changing platforms if P6DOF control surfaces were present. *(Issue #2230)*
* **(2.6.1)** Prevent a hard-lock of the application after using the entity context menu on a large replay file. *(Issue #2313)*
* Fixed a bug where :doc:`Waterfall plots<../wkf_plugin/rv_waterfall>` would not draw correctly when encountering events at time 0. *(ELSZ #212)*
* Fixed an issue with the :command:`WSF_TRACK_PROCESSOR.non_master_track_processor` command adding local tracks to a platforms master track list despite being a non master processor. *(Issue #1411)*
* Fixed an issue where ellipsoids in :class:`WsfDraw` always appear grey when alpha is set to 1. *(Issue #1772)*
* :doc:`Tracks<../wkf_plugin/rv_tracks>` will be visible until a track drop event is received, instead of being removed on the last track update event. *(Issue #1789)*
* Fixed an issue where the application might crash when the loaded recording is rewritten by a simulation. *(Issue #1942)*
* Corrected a message scheduling order issue in AFSIM which could cause a crash when reading event-pipe files. *(Issue #1996)*
* Fixed a bug that caused some jammer volumes not to be drawn. *(Issue #2066)*
* Fixed a bug that caused interaction lines not to show after loading a second recording. *(Issue #2079)*
* Adjusted models' wing-tip locations to be more accurate to draw better :doc:`wing-ribbons<../wkf_plugin/rv_platform_history>`. *(Issue #2151)*
