* **(2.7.4)** Added an error on loading an event-pipe with the incorrect time format. *(AFSIM-2295)*
* **(2.7.4)** Corrected an issue where a crash could occur on review of the AER timestamp at 5 seconds. *(AFSIM-2329)*
* **(2.7.3)** Corrected an issue where weapon-fire events would not affect :doc:`trace-lines<../wkf_plugin/rv_platform_history>`. *(AFSIM-1005)*
* **(2.7.2)** Corrected an issue where some data-types in a replay's schema might cause it to be unreadable without an appropriate data-extension plugin. *(AFSIM-907)*
* **(2.7.2)** Corrected an issue that could cause a crash when paging out script message data. *(AFSIM-955)*
* **(2.7.1)** Corrected an issue which crashes the application on attempts to load an aer file on Linux. *(AFSIM-689)*
* Fixed a range check that was causing sensor volume to be drawn narrow with azimuth ranges from -180 to 180. *(Issue #2232)*
* Added geometry to the termination surface of circular fields of view to make them more spherical. *(AFSIM-290)*
* Corrected an issue where the '-console' command line argument would not work when running from a windows command line. *(Issue #2198)*
* Corrected an issue where :class:`WsfDraw` ellipsoids would not have the appropriate color. *(Issue #2206)*
* Fixed an issue where RV would crash when changing platforms if P6DOF control surfaces were present. *(Issue #2230)*
* Fixed an issue that allowed unintentional panning and zooming of a :doc:`Head Up View<../wkf_plugin/rv_head_up_view>`. *(Issue #2260)*
* Prevent a hard-lock of the application after using the entity context menu on a large replay file. *(Issue #2313)*
* Fixed an issue with the :doc:`Visual Effects<../wkf_plugin/rv_visual_effects>` plugin that would cause slowdown when rewinding. *(Issue #2339)*
* Fixed a crash that sometimes occurred when trying to plot data from a Sensor Track via :doc:`Platform Details<../wkf_plugin/rv_platform_data>`. *(Issue #2381)*
* Fixed an issue where the :doc:`Bookmark Browser<../wkf_plugin/rv_bookmark_browser>` would display duplicate bookmarks upon reloading an AER file. *(Issue #2406)*
* Corrected an issue that prevents detection stop events from being sent when a sensor turns off. *(Issue #2438)*
* Fixed a crash that occurred when opening then closing the :doc:`Quantum Tasker Matrix<../wkf_plugin/rv_quantum_tasker_matrix>` in Mystic. *(Issue #2449)*
* Corrected an issue where :command:`fuel` related values would appear incorrectly in :doc:`Platform Details<../wkf_plugin/rv_platform_data>`. *(Issue #2535)*
* Corrected a bug that could cause a crash five seconds after loading an AER file. *(Issue #2542)*
