* Fixed crash that could occur after using WsfDraw with references to platforms. *(ELSZ #174)*
* Fixed an issue where :doc:`video captures <../wkf_plugin/rv_video_capture>` would not properly capture at real-time. *(Issue #1032)*
* Corrected the representation of range rings, sensor volumes, and orbits on flat maps. *(Issue #1134)*
* Modified the :doc:`tether views <../wkf_plugin/rv_tether_view>` depth buffer to avoid visual artifacts and terrain clipping at long ranges. *(Issue #1155)*
* Corrected an issue where a tether view's camera would be incorrectly placed when the standard view was a flat map.
* Corrected an issue where points of interest would not update when swapping between flat and round maps.
* Corrected an issue where turning on sensor volumes for a hidden platform would show the volume.
* Fixed crash that occurs when using the up arrow key in the chat window with no previously executed commands. *(Issue #1164)*
* Fixed an issue where non-billboarded image based models would not show. *(Issue #1203)*
* Improved the performance when selecting platforms. *(Issue #1245)*
* Corrected an issue where :doc:`traced tracks<../wkf_plugin/rv_tracks>` may show extra events when the same track is correlated multiple times.
* Corrected an issue on Linux that caused replay files to load slowly.
* Fixed an issue with the visualization of :class:`WsfDraw` commands whose vertices are specified in screen coordinates using methods :method:`WsfDraw.VertexScreen` and :method:`WsfDraw.VertexScreenPlat`.
* Fixed a bug which drew :class:`WsfDraw` points as gray.
* Corrected an issue which caused latitude and longitude in the platform options not to be affected by formatting preferences.
* Corrected an issue which caused user preferences towards centering the camera to be ignored.
* Corrected an issue which caused user preferences towards time displays on the status bar to be ignored.
* Corrected an issue which could cause a crash upon receiving invalid :class:`WsfDraw` vertices.
* Corrected an issue which caused a crash that occurred when an implicit weapon generated an :doc:`event marker<../wkf_plugin/rv_event_marker>`.
