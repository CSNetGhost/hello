* Added an :doc:`option<../wkf_plugin/rv_map_display>` to display the altitude of a simulation's loaded DTED under the mouse cursor. *(Issue #1111)*
* The :doc:`Map Overlay Banner  <../wkf_pref_general>` now displays the scenario's classification level, caveats, and trigraphs. The text is controlled via the :command:`classification` command within the scenario. *(ELSZ #98)*
* Added the ability to drag items off of the :doc:`Platform Details<../wkf_plugin/rv_platform_data>`, and onto the :doc:`map<../wkf_plugin/rv_map_display>` or :doc:`tether view<../wkf_plugin/rv_tether_view>`. *(Issue #1361)*
* Added an option to allow the user to choose between a camera that rotates with platform heading and one that does not in :doc:`tether view <../wkf_plugin/rv_tether_view>`. *(Issue #1069)*
* Added a context menu item to plots allowing the user to set the data sampling rate. *(Issue #1344)*
* Platform parts will now be categorized by type in the :doc:`Platform Details<../wkf_plugin/rv_platform_data>`. *(Issue #1337)*
* When applicable, weapon quantity data will be displayed in the Parts category of :doc:`Platform Details<../wkf_plugin/rv_platform_data>`. *(Issue #1338)*
* Added a :doc:`Relative Geometry Dialog<../wkf_plugin/rv_relative_geometry>`. *(Issue #1412)*
* Added several new types of :doc:`Visual Effects<../wkf_plugin/rv_visual_effects>` that can be displayed in tether views.
* Added the :doc:`Type Browser<../wkf_plugin/rv_visibility>` which allows the user to filter the visible platform set by platform type. *(Issue #1430)*
* Added a :doc:`Satellite tether<../wkf_plugin/rv_satellite_tether_view>` which is optimized for high-altitude, and allows for RIC frame trace lines. *(Issue #1432)*
* Updated the coast-line vector layer in the :doc:`Map Display<../wkf_plugin/rv_map_display>`. *(Issue #1464)*
* Added options to load a configuration file from the :doc:`command-line<../mystic_command_line>`. *(Issue #1507)*
* Added an option to zoom at the mouse cursor in the :doc:`Map Display<../wkf_plugin/rv_map_display>`. *(Issue #1519)*
* Added precision settings to the :doc:`Unit Preferences<../wkf_pref_units>` that control the number of decimal places that will be displayed for units of the specified type. *(Issue #1529)*
* Added a :doc:`Cursor Info <../wkf_plugin/rv_cursor_info>` dialog which shows information about the position of the cursor on the :doc:`Map Display<../wkf_plugin/rv_map_display>` *(Issue #1537)*
* Added a :doc:`Line of sight <../wkf_plugin/rv_terrain_tools>` tool. *(Issue #1471)*
* Added the ability to add :doc:`Map Annotations <../wkf_plugin/wk_map_annotation>` to track icons and points of interest.
